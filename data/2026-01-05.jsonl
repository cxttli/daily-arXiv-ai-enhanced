The main goal of an exact repair scheme is to recover the data from a failed node by accessing and downloading information from the rest of the nodes. In a groundbreaking paper, ~\\cite{GW} developed an exact repair scheme for a distributed storage system that is based on Reed-Solomon codes, which depend on single-variable polynomials. In these notes, we extend the repair scheme to the family of distributed storage systems based on Reed-Muller codes, which are linear codes based on multivariate polynomials. The repair scheme we propose repairs any single node failure and multiple node failures, provided the positions satisfy certain conditions."}

In response, the UE is transitioning from a passive transceiver into an active entity that directly contributes to system-level performance. In this context, this article examines the evolving role of the UE in mMIMO systems during the transition from fifth-generation (5G) to sixth-generation (6G), bridging third generation partnership project (3GPP) standardization, device implementation, and architectural innovation. Through a chronological review of 3GPP Releases 15 to 19, we highlight the progression of UE functionalities from basic channel state information (CSI) reporting to artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML)-based CSI enhancement and UE-initiated beam management. We further examine key implementation challenges, including multi-panel UE (MPUE) architectures, on-device intelligent processing, and energy-efficient operation, and then discuss corresponding architectural innovations under practical constraints. Using digital-twin-based evaluations, we validate the impact of emerging UE-centric functionalities, illustrating that UE-initiated beam reporting improves throughput in realistic mobility scenarios, while a multi-panel architecture enhances link robustness compared with a single-panel UE."}

In this paper, we develop a semantic transmission framework for direct satellite communications as an effective and viable solution to tackle this problem. To measure the tradeoffs between communication, computation, and generation quality, we introduce a semantic efficiency metric with optimized weights. The optimization aims to maximize the average semantic efficiency metric by jointly optimizing transmission mode selection, satellite-user association, ISL task migration, denoising steps, and adaptive weights, which is a complex nonlinear integer programming problem. To maximize the average semantic efficiency metric, we propose a decision-assisted REINFORCE++ algorithm that utilizes feasibility-aware action space and a critic-free stabilized policy update.

Consequently, developing deep learning methods that can effectively process EEG signals remains an open and important research problem. To tackle this problem, this work presents a new method inspired by Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF). In computer vision, NeRF techniques train a neural network to memorize the appearance of a 3D scene and then uses its learned parameters to render and edit the scene from any viewpoint. We draw an analogy between the discrete images captured from different viewpoints used to learn a continuous 3D scene in NeRF, and EEG electrodes positioned at different locations on the scalp, which are used to infer the underlying representation of continuous neural activity. Building on this connection, we show that a neural network can be trained on a single EEG sample in a NeRF style manner to produce a fixed size and informative weight vector that encodes the entire signal. Moreover, via this representation we can render the EEG signal at previously unseen time steps and spatial electrode positions. We demonstrate that this approach enables continuous visualization of brain activity at any desired resolution, including ultra high resolution, and reconstruction of raw EEG signals. Finally, our empirical analysis shows that this method can effectively simulate nonexistent electrodes data in EEG recordings, allowing the reconstructed signal to be fed into standard EEG processing networks to improve performance."}

Preventing HF can reduce morbidity and mortality. We hypothesized that artificial intelligence (AI) applied to 24-hour single-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) data could predict the risk of HF within five years. To research this, the Technion-Leumit Holter ECG (TLHE) dataset, including 69,663 recordings from 47,729 patients, collected over 20 years was used. Our deep learning model, DeepHHF, trained on 24-hour ECG recordings, achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.80 that outperformed a model using 30-second segments and a clinical score. High-risk individuals identified by DeepHHF had a two-fold chance of hospitalization or death incidents. Explainability analysis showed DeepHHF focused on arrhythmias and heart abnormalities, with key attention between 8 AM and 3 PM. This study highlights the feasibility of deep learning to model 24-hour continuous ECG data, capturing paroxysmal events and circadian variations essential for reliable risk prediction.

The proposed framework constructs a digital twin of the physical mmWave network using OpenStreetMap, Blender, and NVIDIA Sionna's ray-tracing engine to simulate realistic received signal strength (RSS) maps.

However, this paradigm faces two critical bottlenecks: the prohibitive memory footprint required for local training on resource-constrained gNBs, and the saturation of bandwidth-limited backhaul links during the global aggregation of high-dimensional model updates. To address these challenges, we propose CoCo-Fed, a novel Compression and Combination-based Federated learning framework that unifies local memory efficiency and global communication reduction. Locally, CoCo-Fed breaks the memory wall by performing a double-dimension down-projection of gradients, adapting the optimizer to operate on low-rank structures without introducing additional inference parameters/latency. Globally, we introduce a transmission protocol based on orthogonal subspace superposition, where layer-wise updates are projected and superimposed into a single consolidated matrix per gNB, drastically reducing the backhaul traffic. Beyond empirical designs, we establish a rigorous theoretical foundation, proving the convergence of CoCo-Fed even under unsupervised learning conditions suitable for wireless sensing tasks. Extensive simulations on an angle-of-arrival estimation task demonstrate that CoCo-Fed significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both memory and communication efficiency while maintaining robust convergence under non-IID settings."}

To enable rapid adaptation in highly dynamic environments, the proposed approach employs model-agnostic meta-learning (MAML) to learn a transferable initialization across diverse mobility and channel conditions, allowing few-shot online adaptation using limited pilot feedback. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly outperforms Reptile-based meta-learning, non-meta reinforcement learning, conventional optimization, static antenna placement, and power-only control in terms of outage probability, secrecy performance, and convergence latency. These results establish meta-learning as an effective tool for secure and low-latency control of reconfigurable pinching-antenna systems in non-stationary wireless environments."}

In contrast to previous works, in this paper it is assumed that both the number of observation sequences and the number of outlier sequences grow with the sequence length. In this case, the typical distribution $π$ can be estimated by computing the mean over all observation sequences, provided that the number of outlier sequences is sublinear in the total number of sequences. It is demonstrated that, in this case, one can achieve the error exponent of the maximum likelihood test that has access to both $π$ and $μ$. However, this mean-based test performs poorly when the number of outlier sequences is proportional to the total number of sequences. For this case, a median-based test is proposed that estimates $π$ as the median of all observation sequences. It is demonstrated that the median-based test achieves again the error exponent of the maximum likelihood test that has access to both $π$ and $μ$, but only with probability approaching one. To formalize this case, the typical error exponent -- similar to the typical random coding exponent introduced in the context of random coding for channel coding -- is proposed."}

Traditional channel estimation methods face scalability challenges due to the surging overhead in emerging high-mobility, extremely large-scale multiple-input multiple-output (EL-MIMO), and multi-band systems. CSI extrapolation techniques mitigate these challenges by using partial CSI to infer complete CSI, significantly reducing overhead. Despite growing interest, a comprehensive review of state-of-the-art (SOTA) CSI extrapolation techniques is lacking. This paper addresses this gap by comprehensively reviewing the current status, challenges, and future directions of CSI extrapolation for the first time. Firstly, we analyze the performance metrics specific to CSI extrapolation in 6G, including extrapolation accuracy, adaption to dynamic scenarios and algorithm costs. We then review both model-driven and artificial intelligence (AI)-driven approaches for time, frequency, antenna, and multi-domain CSI extrapolation. Key insights and takeaways from these methods are summarized. Given the promise of AI-driven methods in meeting performance requirements, we also examine the open-source channel datasets and simulators that could be used to train high-performance AI-driven CSI extrapolation models.

In turn, the deployment of mega constellations make it possible for ground users to be in visibility of more than one satellite at the same time, enabling receiver diversity. Therefore, in this paper, we evaluate the impact of multi-receivers in scenarios where IoT nodes share the channel following a non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA)irregular repetition slotted ALOHA (IRSA) protocol. Considering the impairments of satellite channels, we derive a lower bound of system performance, serving as a fast tool for initial evaluation of network behavior.

Multiply-accumulate~(MAC) is considered a {\\textit de facto} unit operation in NNs. By leveraging the inherent parallel processing capabilities of CiM, NNs that require numerous MAC operations can be executed more efficiently. This is further facilitated by storing the weights in SRAM, reducing the need for extensive data movement and enhancing overall computational speed and efficiency. Traditional CiM architectures execute MAC operations in the analog domain, employing an Analog-to-Digital converter (ADC) to convert the analog MAC values into digital outputs. However, these ADCs introduce significant increase in area and power consumption, as well as introduce non-linearities. This work proposes a resonant time-domain compute-in-memory (TDC-CiM) architecture that eliminates the need for an ADC by using a time-to-digital converter (TDC) to digitize analog MAC results with lower power and area cost. A dedicated 8T SRAM cell enables reliable bitwise MAC operations, while the readout uses a 4-bit TDC with pulse-shrinking delay elements, achieving 1 GS/s sampling with a power consumption of only 1.25 mW. In addition, a weight stationary data mapping strategy combined with an automated SRAM macro selection algorithm enables scalable and energy-efficient deployment across CNN workloads. Evaluation across six CNN models shows that the algorithm reduces inference energy consumption by up to 8x when scaling SRAM size from 32~KB to 256~KB, while maintaining minimal accuracy loss after quantization. The feasibility of the proposed architecture is validated on an 8~KB SRAM memory array using TSMC 28~nm technology.

In a nutshell, compared to OFDM, AFDM demonstrates stronger ICI resilience and achieves the maximum full diversity attainable gain even under HWIs, thanks to its intrinsic chirp signalling structure as well as to the beneficial spreading effect of the discrete affine Fourier transform."}

We investigate the architecture of multi-MF-RISs to assist non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) downlink networks. We formulate an energy efficiency (EE) maximization problem by optimizing power allocation, transmit beamforming and MF-RIS configurations of amplitudes, phase-shifts and EH ratios, as well as the position of MF-RISs, while satisfying constraints of available power, user rate requirements, and self-sustainability property. We design a parametrized sharing scheme for multi-agent hybrid deep reinforcement learning (PMHRL), where the multi-agent proximal policy optimization (PPO) and deep-Q network (DQN) handle continuous and discrete variables, respectively. The simulation results have demonstrated that proposed PMHRL has the highest EE compared to other benchmarks, including cases without parametrized sharing, pure PPO and DQN. Moreover, the proposed multi-MF-RISs-aided downlink NOMA achieves the highest EE compared to scenarios of no-EH/amplification, traditional RISs, and deployment without RISs/MF-RISs under different multiple access."}

However, the associated optimization problem is highly nonconvex due to the intricate coupling of log-determinant and matrix trace terms. Existing solutions often suffer from high computational complexity, typically requiring matrix inversion at every iteration. In this paper, we propose a computationally efficient optimization framework based on fractional programming (FP). Our key idea is to reformulate the KLD maximization problem into a sequence of tractable quadratic subproblems using matrix FP. To further reduce complexity, we introduce a nonhomogeneous relaxation technique that replaces the costly linear system solver with a simple closed-form update, thereby reducing the per-iteration complexity to quadratic order. To compensate for the convergence speed trade-off caused by relaxation, we employ an acceleration method called STEM by interpreting the iterative scheme as a fixed-point mapping. The resulting algorithm achieves significantly faster convergence rates with low per-iteration cost. Numerical results demonstrate that our approach reduces the total runtime by orders of magnitude compared to a state-of-the-art benchmark. Finally, we apply the proposed framework to a multiple random access scenario and a joint integrated sensing and communication scenario, validating the efficacy of our framework in such applications."}

However, existing demodulators underperform in generic multi-user environments: classical demodulators struggle to balance accuracy and complexity, while deep learning-based methods lack adaptability under heterogeneous configurations. Although diffusion models have been introduced for demodulation, their flexibility remains limited for practical use. To address these issues, this work proposes WiFo-MUD, a universal diffusion-based foundation model for multi-user demodulation. The model aligns inter-user signal-to-noise ratio imbalance and performs conditional denoising via a customized backbone. Furthermore, a communication-aware consistency distillation method and a dynamic user-grouping strategy are devised to enhance inference. WiFo-MUD achieves state-of-the-art results on large-scale heterogeneous datasets, demonstrating efficient inference and strong generalization across varying system configurations."}

Conventional downlink designs place the entire precoding computation at the BBU and transmit a high-dimensional precoding matrix over the fronthaul, resulting in substantial quantization losses and signaling overhead. This letter proposes a splitting precoding architecture that separates the design between the AAS and BBU. The AAS performs a local subspace selection to reduce the channel dimensionality, while the BBU computes an optimized quantized refinement precoding based on the resulting effective channel. The numerical results show that the proposed splitting precoding strategy achieves higher sum spectral efficiency than conventional one-stage precoding."}

This work presents a systematic investigation of cylindrical RISs, progressing from idealized surface-impedance synthesis to practical implementations based on simple one-bit meta-atoms. Exact analytical and geometrical-optics-based models are first developed to explore fundamental design limits, followed by a semi-analytical formulation tailored to discrete, reconfigurable architectures. This model enables efficient beam synthesis using both evolutionary optimization and low-complexity strategies, including the minimum power distortionless response method, and is validated through full-wave simulations. Results confirm that one-bit RISs can achieve directive scattering with manageable sidelobe levels and minimal hardware complexity. These findings establish the viability of cylindrical RISs and open the door to their integration into dual-use wireless platforms for real-world communication scenarios."}

In addition, two reconfigurable metasurfaces are deployed, one in the immediate vicinity of the transmit antenna array, and one in the immediate vicinity of the receive antenna array. The resulting architecture implements a holographic beamforming structure at both the transmitter and receiver. In this scenario, the system energy efficiency is optimized with respect to the transmit covariance matrix, and the reflection matrices of the two metasurfaces. A low-complexity algorithm is developed, which is guaranteed to converge to a first-order optimal point of the energy efficiency maximization problem. Moreover, closed-form expressions are derived for the metasurface matrices in the special case of single-antenna or single-stream transmission. The two metasurfaces are considered to be nearly-passive and subject to global reflection constraints. A numerical performance analysis is conducted to assess the performance of the proposed optimization methods, showing, in particular, that the use of holographic beamforming by metasurfaces can provide significant energy efficiency gains compared to fully digital beamforming architectures, even when the latter achieve substantial multiplexing gains."}

In response, the UE is transitioning from a passive transceiver into an active entity that directly contributes to system-level performance. In this context, this article examines the evolving role of the UE in mMIMO systems during the transition from fifth-generation (5G) to sixth-generation (6G), bridging third generation partnership project (3GPP) standardization, device implementation, and architectural innovation. Through a chronological review of 3GPP Releases 15 to 19, we highlight the progression of UE functionalities from basic channel state information (CSI) reporting to artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML)-based CSI enhancement and UE-initiated beam management. We further examine key implementation challenges, including multi-panel UE (MPUE) architectures, on-device intelligent processing, and energy-efficient operation, and then discuss corresponding architectural innovations under practical constraints. Using digital-twin-based evaluations, we validate the impact of emerging UE-centric functionalities, illustrating that UE-initiated beam reporting improves throughput in realistic mobility scenarios, while a multi-panel architecture enhances link robustness compared with a single-panel UE."}

In this paper, we develop a semantic transmission framework for direct satellite communications as an effective and viable solution to tackle this problem. To measure the tradeoffs between communication, computation, and generation quality, we introduce a semantic efficiency metric with optimized weights. The optimization aims to maximize the average semantic efficiency metric by jointly optimizing transmission mode selection, satellite-user association, ISL task migration, denoising steps, and adaptive weights, which is a complex nonlinear integer programming problem. To maximize the average semantic efficiency metric, we propose a decision-assisted REINFORCE++ algorithm that utilizes feasibility-aware action space and a critic-free stabilized policy update. Numerical results show that the proposed algorithm achieves higher semantic efficiency than baselines."}

Providing such guarantees is difficult in practice because clock synchronization is inherently imperfect: events generated at different clients within a short time window may carry timestamps that cannot be reliably ordered. Rather than attempting to eliminate synchronization error, we embrace it and establish a probabilistically fair sequencing process. Tommy is a sequencer that uses a statistical model of per-clock synchronization error to compare noisy timestamps probabilistically. Although this enables ordering of two events, the probabilistic comparator is intransitive, making global ordering non-trivial. We address this challenge by mapping the sequencing problem to a classical ranking problem from social choice theory, which offers principled mechanisms for reasoning with intransitive comparisons. Using this formulation, Tommy produces a partial order of events, achieving significantly better fairness than a Spanner TrueTime-based baseline approach."}

Establishing direct optical paths can reduce congestion and propagation delay, but each reconfiguration incurs non-negligible overhead, making naive per-step reconfiguration impractical.\n  We present Harvest, a systematic approach for synthesizing topology reconfiguration schedules that minimize collective completion time in photonic interconnects. Given a collective communication algorithm and its fixed communication schedule, Harvest determines how the interconnect should evolve over the course of the collective, explicitly balancing reconfiguration delay against congestion and propagation delay. We reduce the synthesis problem into a dynamic program with an underlying topology optimization subproblem and show that the approach applies to arbitrary collective communication algorithms. Furthermore, we exploit the algorithmic structure of a well-known AllReduce algorithm (Recursive Doubling) to synthesize optimal reconfiguration schedules without using any optimizers. By parameterizing the formulation using reconfiguration delay, Harvest naturally adapts to various photonic technologies. Using packet-level and flow-level evaluations, as well as hardware emulation on commercial GPUs, we show that the schedules synthesized by Harvest significantly reduce collective completion time across multiple collective algorithms compared to static interconnects and reconfigure-every-step baselines."}

Compared to monolithic applications, microservices demand higher performance and stricter isolation from load balancers.

Traditional sidecar-based load balancers are ill-equipped to meet these demands, often resulting in significant performance degradation.\n  In this work, we present XLB, a novel architecture that reshapes L7 load balancers as in-kernel interposition operating on the socket layer. We leverage eBPF to implement the core load balancing logic in the kernel, and address the connection management and state maintenance challenges through novel socket layer redirection and nested eBPF maps designs. XLB eliminates the extra overhead of scheduling, communication, and data movement, resulting in a more lightweight, scalable, and efficient L7 load balancer architecture. Compared to the widely used microservices load balancers (Istio and Cilium), over 50 microservice instances, XLB achieves up to 1.5x higher throughput and 60% lower end-to-end latency."}

In the 3GPP standardization of 5G systems, the 5G Quality of Service (QoS) Identifier (5QI) is defined to characterize the QoS requirements of different traffic requirements. However, it falls short in capturing the diverse latency, capacity, and reliability profiles of NTN environments, particularly when NTNs are used as backhaul. Furthermore, it is difficult to manage individual traffic flows and perform efficient resource allocation and routing when a large number of 5G traffic flows are present in NTN systems. To address these challenges, we propose an optimization framework that enhances QoS handling by introducing an NTN QoS Identifier (NQI) and grouping 5G traffic into NTN slices based on similar requirements. This enables unified resource control and routing for a large number of 5G flows in NTN systems. In this paper, we present the detailed procedure of the proposed framework, which consists of 5QI to NQI mapping, NTN traffic to NTN slice mapping, and slice-level flow and routing optimization. We evaluate the framework by comparing multiple mapping schemes through numerical simulations and analyze their impact on overall network performance."}

Meanwhile, modern planters, sprayers, and Virtual Terminals are already constrained by the bus bandwidth. This paper presents ISO FastLane, a gateway-less dual-stack approach that routes point-to-point ISOBUS traffic over Ethernet while keeping broadcast messages on the existing CAN bus. The solution requires no new state machines, no middleware, and no changes to application layer code: only a simple Layer~3 routing decision and a lightweight peer discovery mechanism called Augmented Address Claim (AACL). Legacy devices continue to operate unmodified and unaware of FastLane traffic. Preliminary tests reported on the paper demonstrate that ISO FastLane accelerates Virtual Terminal object pool uploads by factor of 8 and sustains Task Controller message rates over 100 times beyond the current specification limit. Because ISO FastLane builds entirely on existing J1939 and ISO~11783 conventions, it can be implemented by ISOBUS engineers in a matter of weeks.

Machine learning (ML)-based localization using channel state information (CSI) is one of the most popular methods for achieving high-accuracy localization with low cost. However, to be accurate and robust, ML-based algorithms need to be trained and tested with large amounts of data, covering not only many user equipment (UE)/target locations, but also many different access points (APs) locations to which the UEs connect, in a variety of different environment types. This paper presents a massive-sized CSI dataset, WiLoc (Wi-Fi Localization), and makes it publicly available. WiLoc is obtained by a series of precision measurement campaigns that span three months, and it is massive in all the above-mentioned three dimensions: > 12 million UE locations, > 3,000 APs, covering 16 buildings for indoor localization, and > 30 streets for outdoor use. The paper describes the dataset structure, measurement environments, measurement protocols, and the dataset validations. Comprehensive case studies validate the advantages of large datasets in ML-driven localization strategies for both \"standard\" and transfer learning.

We reinterpret the Fermat equation as an $n$-th moment constraint, constructing a statistical manifold $\\mathcal{M}_n$ of generalized normal distributions via the Maximum Entropy Principle. By Chentsov's Theorem, the natural metric is the Fisher information metric ($L^2$); however, the global structure is governed by the $L^n$ moment constraint. This reveals a discrepancy between the local quadratic metric and the global $L^n$ structure. We axiomatically define an \"Information-Geometric Fermat Solution,\" postulating that the lattice structure must maintain \"dual lattice consistency\" under the Legendre transform. We prove the non-existence of such structures for $n \\ge 3$. Through the Poisson Summation Formula and Hausdorff-Young Inequality, we demonstrate that the Fourier transform induces an alteration of the function family ($L^n \\to L^q$, where $1/n + 1/q = 1$), rendering dual lattice consistency analytically impossible. This identifies a geometric obstruction where integer and energy structures are incompatible within a dually flat space.

This paper presents a foundation model-aided hierarchical deep reinforcement learning (FM-HDRL) framework designed for joint beamforming and phase-shift optimization in RIS-assisted wireless networks. To implement this, we first fine-tune a pre-trained large wireless model (LWM) to translate raw channel data into low-dimensional, context-aware channel state information (CSI) embeddings. Next, these embeddings are combined with user location information and blockage status to select the optimal communication path. The resulting features are then fed into an HDRL model, assumed to be implemented at a centralized controller, which jointly optimizes the base station (BS) beamforming vectors and the RIS phase-shift configurations to maximize SE. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed FM-HDRL framework consistently outperforms baseline methods in terms of convergence speed, spectral efficiency, and scalability. According to the simulation results, our proposed method improves 7.82% SE compared to the FM-aided deep reinforcement learning (FM-DRL) approach and a substantial enhancement of about 48.66% relative to the beam sweeping approach."}

It is closely related to other causal influence measures, such as transfer entropy, Granger causality, and Pearl's causal framework. This monograph provides an overview of DI and its main application in information theory, namely, characterizing the capacity of channels with feedback and memory. We begin by reviewing the definitions of DI, its basic properties, and its relation to Shannon's mutual information. Next, we provide a survey of DI estimation techniques, ranging from classic plug-in estimators to modern neural-network-based estimators. Considering the application of channel capacity estimation, we describe how such estimators numerically optimize DI rate over a class of joint distributions on input and output processes. A significant part of the monograph is devoted to techniques to compute the feedback capacity of finite-state channels (FSCs). The feedback capacity of a strongly connected FSC involves the maximization of the DI rate from the channel input process to the output process. This maximization is performed over the class of causal conditioned probability input distributions. When the FSC is also unifilar, i.e., the next state is given by a time-invariant function of the current state and the new input-output symbol pair, the feedback capacity is the optimal average reward of an appropriately formulated Markov decision process (MDP). This MDP formulation has been exploited to develop several methods to compute exactly, or at least estimate closely, the feedback capacity of a unifilar FSC. This monograph describes these methods, starting from the value iteration algorithm, to Q-graph methods, and reinforcement learning algorithms that can handle large input and output alphabets."}

While recent data-driven approaches, particularly Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), have shown promise in dynamic environments, they often suffer from prohibitive training overhead, poor generalization to topology changes, and high computational complexity. To address these limitations, this paper proposes Satisfaction-driven Coverage Optimization via Perimeter Extraction (SCOPE), a training-free and online 3D deployment framework. Unlike heuristic baselines that rely on fixed-altitude assumptions, SCOPE integrates a perimeter extraction mechanism with the Smallest Enclosing Circle (SEC) algorithm to dynamically optimize 3D UAV positions. Theoretically, we provide a rigorous convergence proof of the proposed algorithm and derive its polynomial time complexity of $O(N^2 \\log N)$. Experimentally, we conduct a comprehensive comparative study against state-of-the-art DRL baselines (e.g., PPO). Simulation results demonstrate that SCOPE achieves comparable user satisfaction to DRL methods but significantly lower computational latency (milliseconds vs. hours of training) and superior energy efficiency, making it an ideal solution for real-time, on-demand emergency deployment."}

Building walls introduce considerable attenuation on the radar signals. When the transmitted power is raised to compensate the through-wall attenuation, the direct coupling between the transmitter and receiver can saturate the receiver because of which weaker reflections off the target may remain undetected. In this paper, we propose using transmitter and receiver antennas of orthogonal circular polarization to reduce the direct coupling between the transmitter and receiver while retaining the first bounce off the target. In our paper, we demonstrate that the quadrafilar helical antenna (QHA) is a good candidate for this operation since it is characterized by a small size, wide frequency band of operation, high gain and low axial ratio over a wide field of view. We compare the reduced mutual coupling between the transmitter and receiver elements for the oppositely polarized QHA antennas with other commonly used through-wall radar antennas such as the Vivaldi and horn antennas. The system is tested in through-wall conditions."}

Under review at an IEEE Journal", "summary": "In the era of 6G Air-Ground Integrated Networks (AGINs), Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are pivotal for providing on-demand wireless coverage in mission-critical environments, such as post-disaster rescue operations. However, traditional Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) approaches for multi-UAV orchestration often face critical challenges: instability due to the non-stationarity of multi-agent environments and the difficulty of balancing energy efficiency with service equity. To address these issues, this paper proposes ORCHID (Orchestration of Resilient Coverage via Hybrid Intelligent Deployment), a novel stability-enhanced two-stage learning framework. First, ORCHID leverages a GBS-aware topology partitioning strategy to mitigate the exploration cold-start problem. Second, we introduce a Reset-and-Finetune (R\\&F) mechanism within the MAPPO architecture that stabilizes the learning process via synchronized learning rate decay and optimizer state resetting. This mechanism effectively suppresses gradient variance to prevent policy degradation, thereby ensuring algorithmic resilience in dynamic environments. Furthermore, we uncover a counter-intuitive efficiency-fairness synergy: contrary to the conventional trade-off, our results demonstrate that the proposed Max-Min Fairness (MMF) design not only guarantees service for cell-edge users but also achieves superior energy efficiency compared to Proportional Fairness (PF), which tends to converge to suboptimal greedy equilibria. Extensive experiments confirm that ORCHID occupies a superior Pareto-dominant position compared to state-of-the-art baselines, ensuring robust convergence and resilient connectivity in mission-critical scenarios."}

However, deploying separate radars and communication devices involves the allocation of individual frequency bands and hardware platforms. Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) offers a robust solution to the challenges of spectral congestion by utilizing a shared waveform, hardware, and spectrum for both localization of mobile users and communication. Various waveforms, including phase-modulated continuous waves (PMCW) and frequency-modulated continuous waves (FMCW), have been explored for target localization using traditional radar. On the other hand, new protocols such as the IEEE 802.11ad have been proposed to support wideband communication between vehicles. This paper compares both traditional radar and communication candidate waveforms for ISAC to detect single-point and extended targets. We show that the response of FMCW to mobile targets is poorer than that of PMCW. However, the IEEE 802.11ad radar outperforms PMCW radar and FMCW radar. Additionally, the radar signal processing algorithms are implemented on Zynq system-on-chip through hardware-software co-design and fixed-point analysis to evaluate their computational complexity in real-world implementations."}

In this paper, we introduce a new type of matrix called a \\emph{consta-$g$-circulant matrix}, which extends the idea of $g$-circulant matrices.

While Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) has shown promise in autonomous coordination, its resilience under sudden node failures remains a challenge due to dynamic topology deformation. This paper proposes a Topology-Aware Graph MAPPO (TAG-MAPPO) framework designed to enhance system survivability through autonomous 3D spatial reconfiguration. Our framework incorporates graph-based feature aggregation with a residual ego-state fusion mechanism to capture intricate inter-agent dependencies. This architecture enables the surviving swarm to rapidly adapt its topology compared to conventional Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) based approaches. Extensive simulations across heterogeneous environments, ranging from interference-limited Crowded Urban to sparse Rural areas, validate the proposed approach. The results demonstrate that TAG-MAPPO consistently outperforms baselines in both stability and efficiency; specifically, it reduces redundant handoffs by up to 50 percent while maintaining a lead in energy efficiency. Most notably, the framework exhibits exceptional self-healing capabilities following a catastrophic node failure. TAG-MAPPO restores over 90 percent of the pre-failure service coverage within 15 time steps, exhibiting a significantly faster V-shaped recovery trajectory than MLP baselines. Furthermore, in dense urban scenarios, the framework achieves a post-failure Jain's Fairness Index that even surpasses its original four-UAV configuration by effectively resolving service overlaps. These findings suggest that topology-aware coordination is essential for the realization of resilient 6G aerial networks and provides a robust foundation for adaptive deployments in volatile environments."}

Timely and accurate fault detection is essential to prevent unexpected failures and reduce maintenance costs. Traditional diagnostic methods often rely on manual feature extraction and shallow classifiers, which may be inadequate for capturing the complex patterns embedded in raw vibration signals. In this study, a compact one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D CNN) is developed for automated bearing fault diagnosis using raw time-domain vibration data, eliminating the need for manual feature engineering. The model is trained and evaluated on two established benchmark datasets: the Case Western Reserve University (CWRU) dataset and the Paderborn University (PU) dataset. The CWRU data were segmented based on four distinct motor load conditions (0 HP to 3 HP), with each load scenario trained and tested independently to ensure strict separation and prevent data leakage. The CNN achieved high average test accuracies of 99.14%, 98.85%, 97.42%, and 95.14% for 0 HP, 1 HP, 2 HP, and 3 HP, respectively. On the PU dataset, known for its naturally induced faults and greater operational variability the model achieved a robust average testing accuracy of 95.63%. These results affirm the model ability to generalize across datasets and varying operating conditions. Further improvements were observed through hyperparameter tuning, particularly window length and training epochs, underscoring the importance of tailored configurations for specific datasets and load conditions. Overall, the proposed method demonstrates the effectiveness and scalability of 1D CNNs for real-time, data-driven bearing fault diagnosis, offering a reliable foundation for condition monitoring in industrial applications."}

Here, we investigate covert communications in the presence of a disco reconfigurable intelligent surface (DRIS) deployed by the warden Willie, which simultaneously reduces his detection error probabilities and degrades the communication performance between Alice and Bob, without relying on either channel state information (CSI) or additional jamming power. However, the introduction of the DRIS renders it intractable for Willie to construct a Neyman-Pearson (NP) detector, since the probability density function (PDF) of the test statistic is analytically intractable under the Alice-Bob transmission hypothesis. Moreover, given the adversarial relationship between Willie and Alice/Bob, it is unrealistic to assume that Willie has access to a labeled training dataset. To address these challenges, we propose an unsupervised masked autoregressive flow (MAF)-based NP detection framework that exploits prior knowledge inherent in covert communications. We further define the false alarm rate (FAR) and the missed detection rate (MDR) as monitoring performance metrics for Willie, and the signal-to-jamming-plus-noise ratio (SJNR) as a communication performance metric for Alice-Bob transmissions. Furthermore, we derive theoretical expressions for SJNR and uncover unique properties of covert communications in the presence of a DRIS.

To overcome these obstacles, high-altitude platform station (HAPS) equipped with a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS), so-called HAPS-RIS, is a promising candidate. We propose a novel unified joint multi-objective framework where UAVs and HAPS-RIS are fully integrated to extend coverage and enhance network performance. This joint multi-objective design maximizes the number of users served by the HAPS-RIS, minimizes the number of UAVs deployed and minimizes the total average UAV path loss subject to quality-of-service (QoS) and resource constraints. We propose a novel low-complexity solution strategy by proving the equivalence between minimizing the total average UAV path loss upper bound and k-means clustering, deriving a practical closed-form RIS phase-shift design, and introducing a mapping technique that collapses the combinatorial assignments into a zone radius and a bandwidth-portioning factor. Then, we propose a dynamic Pareto optimization technique to solve the transformed optimization problem. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that the proposed framework adapts seamlessly across operating regimes. A HAPS-RIS-only setup achieves full coverage at low data rates, but UAV assistance becomes indispensable as rate demands increase. By tuning a single bandwidth portioning factor, the model recovers UAV-only, HAPS-RIS-only and equal bandwidth portioning baselines within one formulation and consistently surpasses them across diverse rate requirements. The simulations also quantify a tangible trade-off between RIS scale and UAV deployment, enabling designers to trade increased RIS elements for fewer UAVs as service demands evolve."}

In our experiment, commodity WiFi transceivers are used, representing a practical MIMO system. In this context, we propose a passive beam-focusing technique to manipulate the propagation channel between each transmit-receive antenna pair and achieve a favorable propagation condition for rank improvement. The proposed algorithm is tested in two different channel scenarios: low and medium ranks. Experimental results show that, when the channel is rank-deficient, the RIS can significantly increase the rank by $112\\%$ from its default value without the RIS, providing a rank increment of $1.5$. When the rank has a medium value, a maximum of $61\\%$ enhancement can be achieved, corresponding to a rank increment of $1$. These results provide the first experimental evidence of RIS-driven rank manipulation with off-the-shelf WiFi hardware, offering practical insights into RIS deployment for spatial multiplexing gains."}

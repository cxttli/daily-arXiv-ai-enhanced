Abstract: The advent of 5G and the emergence of 6G networks demand unprecedented flexibility and efficiency in Radio Access Network (RAN) resource management to satisfy diverse service-level agreements (SLAs). Existing RAN slicing frameworks predominantly rely on per-slice resource reservation, which ensures performance isolation but leads to inefficient utilization, particularly under bursty traffic. We introduce HyRA, a hybrid resource allocation framework for RAN slicing that combines dedicated per-slice allocations with shared resource pooling across slices. HyRA preserves performance isolation while improving resource efficiency by leveraging multiplexing gains in bursty traffic conditions. We formulate this design as a bi-level stochastic optimization problem, where the outer loop determines the dedicated and shared resource budgets and the inner loop performs per-UE scheduling under a novel water-filling approach. By using the sample-average approximation, the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions of the inner loop, and Big-M encoding, we transform the problem into a tractable mixed-integer program that standard optimization solvers can solve. Extensive simulations under diverse demand patterns, SLA configurations, and traffic burstiness show that HyRA achieves up to 50-75% spectrum savings compared to dedicated-only and shared-only baselines. These results highlight HyRA as a viable approach for resource-efficient, SLA-compliant RAN slicing in future mobile networks.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Independent, street address-level broadband data is essential for evaluating Internet infrastructure investments, such as the $42B Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment (BEAD) program. Evaluating these investments requires longitudinal visibility into broadband availability, quality, and affordability, including data on pre-disbursement baselines and changes in providers' advertised plans. While such data can be obtained through Internet Service Provider (ISP) web interfaces, these workloads impose three fundamental system requirements: robustness to frequent interface evolution, extensibility across hundreds of providers, and low technical overhead for non-expert users. Existing systems fail to meet these three essential requirements.
  We present BQT+, a broadband plan measurement framework that replaces monolithic workflows with declarative state/action specifications. BQT+ models querying intent as an interaction state space, formalized as an abstract nondeterministic finite automaton (NFA), and selects execution paths at runtime to accommodate alternative interaction flows and localized interface changes. We show that BQT+ sustains longitudinal monitoring of 64 ISPs, supporting querying for over 100 ISPs. We apply it to two policy studies: constructing a BEAD pre-disbursement baseline and benchmarking broadband affordability across over 124,000 addresses in four states.

Abstract: Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS) enable dynamic electromagnetic control for 6G networks, but existing control schemes lack responsiveness to fast-varying network conditions, limiting their applicability for ultra-reliable low latency communications. This work addresses uplink delay minimization in multi-RIS scenarios with heterogeneous per-user latency and reliability demands. We propose Delay-Aware RIS Orchestrator (DARIO), an O-RAN-compliant framework that dynamically assigns RIS devices to users within short time windows, adapting to traffic fluctuations to meet per-user delay and reliability targets. DARIO relies on a novel Stochastic Network Calculus (SNC) model to analytically estimate the delay bound for each possible user-RIS assignment under specific traffic and service dynamics. These estimations are used by DARIO to formulate a Nonlinear Integer Program (NIP), for which an online heuristic provides near-optimal performance with low computational overhead. Extensive evaluations with simulations and real traffic traces show consistent delay reductions up to 95.7% under high load or RIS availability.

Abstract: In this work, we study a hierarchical non-terrestrial network as an edge-cloud platform for remote computing of tasks generated by remote ad-hoc healthcare facility deployments, or internet of medical things (IoMT) devices. We consider a high altitude platform station (HAPS) to provide local multiaccess edge server (MEC) services to a set of remote ground medical devices, and a low-earth orbit (LEO) satellite, serving as a bridge to a remote cloud computing server through a ground gateway (GW), providing a large amount of computing resources to the HAPS. In this hierarchical system, the HAPS and the cloud server charges the ground users and the HAPS for the use of the spectrum and the computing of their tasks respectively. Each tier seeks to maximize their own utility in a selfish manner. To encourage the prompt computation of the tasks, a local delay cost is assumed. We formulate the optimal per-task cost at each tier that influences the corresponding offloading policies, and find the corresponding optimal bandwidth allocation.

Abstract: Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) continue to evolve rapidly, and system latency remains one of their most critical performance parameters, particularly when vehicles are operated remotely. Existing latency-assessment methodologies focus predominantly on Glass-to-Glass (G2G) latency, defined as the delay between an event occurring in the operational environment, its capture by a camera, and its subsequent display to the remote operator. However, G2G latency accounts for only one component of the total delay experienced by the driver. The complementary component, Motion-to-Motion (M2M) latency, represents the delay between the initiation of a control input by the remote driver and the corresponding physical actuation by the vehicle. Together, M2M and G2G constitute the overall End-to-End (E2E) latency. This paper introduces a measurement framework capable of quantifying M2M, G2G, and E2E latencies using gyroscopes, a phototransistor, and two GPS-synchronized Raspberry Pi 5 units. The system employs low-pass filtering and threshold-based detection to identify steering-wheel motion on both the remote operator and vehicle sides. An interrupt is generated when the phototransistor detects the activation of an LED positioned within the camera's Field Of View (FOV). Initial measurements obtained from our teleoperated prototype vehicle over commercial 4G and 5G networks indicate an average E2E latency of approximately 500 ms (measurement precision +/- 4 ms). The M2M latency contributes up to 60% of this value.

Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)-assisted networks are increasingly foreseen as a promising approach for emergency response, providing rapid, flexible, and resilient communications in environments where terrestrial infrastructure is degraded or unavailable. In such scenarios, voice radio communications remain essential for first responders due to their robustness; however, their unstructured nature prevents direct integration with automated UAV-assisted network management. This paper proposes SIREN, an AI-driven framework that enables voice-driven perception for UAV-assisted networks. By integrating Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) with Large Language Model (LLM)-based semantic extraction and Natural Language Processing (NLP) validation, SIREN converts emergency voice traffic into structured, machine-readable information, including responding units, location references, emergency severity, and Quality-of-Service (QoS) requirements. SIREN is evaluated using synthetic emergency scenarios with controlled variations in language, speaker count, background noise, and message complexity. The results demonstrate robust transcription and reliable semantic extraction across diverse operating conditions, while highlighting speaker diarization and geographic ambiguity as the main limiting factors. These findings establish the feasibility of voice-driven situational awareness for UAV-assisted networks and show a practical foundation for human-in-the-loop decision support and adaptive network management in emergency response operations.

Abstract: Machine learning training places immense demands on cluster networks, motivating specialized architectures and co-design with parallelization strategies. Recent designs incorporating optical circuit switches (OCSes) are promising, offering improved cost, power efficiency, and long-term bandwidth scaling than packet switches. However, most existing approaches rely on costly high-radix OCSes and/or combine them with packet switches to achieve competitive performance at scale. Unfortunately, high-radix OCSes are both expensive and slow to reconfigure, limiting both scalability and performance.
  We propose Arrays of Cheap Optical Switches (ACOS), which bring application co-design directly to the structure of the reconfigurable fabric. Using low-radix OCSes as building blocks, ACOS supports the forms of reconfiguration needed in training clusters including topology selection, workload adaptation, and failure resilience. The cost of ACOS scales with supported topologies and adaptations rather than with port count, breaking past the scalability barriers of current specialized ML networks. We show through simulation that ACOS-based deployments match the performance of fully provisioned packet-switched networks when training state-of-the-art LLMs at scale, while delivering significant cost savings using existing off-the-shelf OCSes, with strong bandwidth scaling and higher cost savings in the future.

Abstract: In today's world, modern infrastructures are being equipped with information and communication technologies to create large IoT networks.
  It is essential to monitor these networks to ensure smooth operations by detecting and correcting link failures or abnormal network behaviour proactively, which can otherwise cause interruptions in business operations.
  This paper presents a novel method for detecting anomalies in wireless links using graph neural networks. The proposed approach involves converting time series data into graphs and training a new graph neural network architecture based on graph attention networks that successfully detects anomalies at the level of individual measurements of the time series data. The model provides competitive results compared to the state of the art while being computationally more efficient with ~171 times fewer trainable parameters.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The goal of $L$-step speculative decoding is to accelerate autoregressive decoding of a target model by using a cheaper draft model to generate a candidate path of $L$ tokens. Based on a verification algorithm involving target and draft model probabilities, a prefix of the candidate sequence is accepted, and an additional correction token is sampled from a residual distribution to ensure that the final output adheres to the target distribution. While standard speculative decoding uses a verification algorithm which is independent at each token on the path, a recent extension called block verification uses a joint condition involving all sampled on-path probabilities. Block verification (BV) was shown to be optimal over all verification algorithms which use only on-path probabilities, improving on standard speculative decoding. In this work, we first show that block verification is optimal even over verification algorithms that use off-path probabilities, by constructing an information-agnostic linear program (LP). Further, we can extend our LP to the setting where the draft model samples multiple candidate paths, and use it to construct a natural class of multi-path block verification generalizations. While computing the optimal algorithm in this class is not tractable, by considering a stricter class of greedy algorithms, we can formulate an efficient method called greedy multi-path block verification (GBV). Empirically, GBV can improve block efficiency by over 30% and reduce decoding walltimes by over 15% relative to BV. On Llama-3 70B, GBV can improve the end-to-end decoding throughput over SOTA multi-path verification methods by more than 15%.

Abstract: Augmented reality (AR)-enabled Metaverse is a promising technique to provide immersive service experience for mobile users. However, the limited network resources and unpredictable wireless propagation environments are key design bottlenecks of AR-enabled Metaverse systems. Therefore, this paper presents a resource management framework for simultaneously transmitting and reflecting RIS (STAR-RIS)-assisted AR-enabled Metaverse, where the STAR-RIS is configured to improve the communication efficiency between AR users and the Metaverse server located at the base station (BS). Moreover, we formulate a service latency minimization problem via jointly optimizing the computation resource allocation of the BS, coefficient matrix of the STAR-RIS, central processing unit (CPU) frequency and transmit power of the AR users. To tackle the non-convex problem, we utilize an approximate method to transform it to a tractable form, and decouple the multi-dimensional variables via the alternating optimization method. Particularly, the optimal coefficient matrix is obtained by a penalty function-based method with proved convergence, the CPU frequencies of AR users are derived as the closed-form solution, and the transmit power of AR users and computation resource allocation of the BS are obtained by the Lagrange duality method and convex optimization theory. Finally, simulation results demonstrates that the proposed method achieves remarkable latency reduction than several benchmark methods.

Abstract: Semantic communication aims to convey meaning for effective task execution, but differing latent representations in AI-native devices can cause semantic mismatches that hinder mutual understanding. This paper introduces a novel approach to mitigating latent space misalignment in multi-agent AI- native semantic communications. In a downlink scenario, we consider an access point (AP) communicating with multiple users to accomplish a specific AI-driven task. Our method implements a protocol that shares a semantic pre-equalizer at the AP and local semantic equalizers at user devices, fostering mutual understanding and task-oriented communication while considering power and complexity constraints. To achieve this, we employ a federated optimization for the decentralized training of the semantic equalizers at the AP and user sides. Numerical results validate the proposed approach in goal-oriented semantic communication, revealing key trade-offs among accuracy, com- munication overhead, complexity, and the semantic proximity of AI-native communication devices.

Abstract: Envelope extraction in nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) is a fundamental step for processing the data space generated by this technique. Envelope detection accuracy improves with increasing the number of sampling points; however, we propose a novel transform that enables acceptable envelope extraction with significantly fewer sampling points, even without meeting the Nyquist rate. In this paper, we challenge the traditional scale definition and demonstrate that classic scaling lacks a physical referent in all situations. To achieve this aim, we introduce a scale based on the variations of space-invariant states, rather than the observable characteristics of matter and energy. According to this definition of the scale, we distinguished two kinds of observers: scale-variant and scale-invariant. We demonstrated that converting a scale-variant observer to a scale-invariant observer is equivalent to envelop extraction. To analyse and study the theories presented in the paper, we have designed and implemented an Earth-field NMR setup and used real data generated by it to evaluate the performance of the proposed envelope-detection transform. We compared the output of the proposed transform with that of classic and state-of-the-art methods for parameter recovery of NMR signals.

Abstract: This paper develops an end-to-end odor communication model for stress signaling between plants using Green Leaf Volatiles (GLV). A damaged transmitter plant emits (Z)-3-hexenal, (Z)-3-hexenol, and (Z)-3-hexenyl acetate, which propagate through a time-varying diffusion-advection channel and undergo multiplicative loss at the receiver. The sink plant is modeled with a biochemical receiver network that converts the received GLVs into the defensive metabolite (Z)-3-hexenyl $β$-vicianoside, and an alarm decision is defined based on its concentration level. Numerical results show that (Z)-3-hexenol is the primary driver of the system and that plant perception generally operates in a non-linear region. These findings provide a framework for understanding the evolution of plant-plant communication and for developing next-generation precision farming technologies.

Abstract: Developing foundation models for electroencephalography (EEG) remains challenging due to the signal's low signal-to-noise ratio and complex spectro-temporal non-stationarity. Existing approaches often overlook the hierarchical latent structure inherent in neural dynamics, leading to suboptimal reconstruction of fine-grained information. In this work, we propose BrainRVQ, a general-purpose EEG foundation model pre-trained on a large-scale corpus of clinical EEG data. Unlike standard masked modeling, BrainRVQ features a Dual-Domain Residual Vector Quantization (DD-RVQ) tokenizer that disentangles temporal waveforms and spectral patterns into hierarchical discrete codes. We further introduce a hierarchical autoregressive pre-training objective that learns to reconstruct these codes in a coarse-to-fine manner, utilizing an importance-guided curriculum masking strategy to prioritize information-rich neural events over background noise. Extensive experiments across 8 diverse downstream datasets demonstrate that BrainRVQ consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, validating its effectiveness in learning robust and generalizable neural representations.

Abstract: This paper investigates covert multi-hop communication in wireless networks where an adversary employs a cyclostationary (cycle) detector to reveal hidden transmissions. The covert route employs direct sequence spread spectrum (DSSS) signaling to ensure either maximum end-to-end covertness maximization or minimum latency minimization-under quality-of-service (QoS) and link budget constraints. Optimal bandwidth, transmit power, and spreading gain for each hop jointly satisfy reliability and either rate or covertness requirements. We show the equivalence between the covertness and the detection SNR gain-based widest-path formulations, and, hence, enabling efficient route computation. Numerical simulations in a realistic 3D environment illustrate that (i) end-to-end latency increases exponentially with the covertness requirement, (ii) the end-to-end latency increase is super-linear with the packet size M, and (iii) cycle and energy detectors impose different latency behavior as a function of the message length and the covertness requirement. The proposed framework provides important insights into resource allocation and routing design for covert networks against advanced detection adversaries.

Abstract: Existing studies on generalized pinching-antenna systems are predominantly link-level, which optimize system parameters for a given user set with objectives defined by per-user performance metrics. Such designs do not capture network-level requirements, e.g., region-wide coverage and location fairness, and may require frequent re-optimization as users move or enter/leave, incurring control overhead and sensitivity to localization errors. Motivated by this gap, this two-part paper aims to develop an environment-aware network-level design framework for generalized pinching-antenna systems. Part I focuses on the traffic-aware case, where user presence is modeled statistically by a spatial traffic map and performance is optimized and evaluated in a traffic-aware sense; Part II addresses the geometry-aware case in obstacle-rich environments. In Part~I, we introduce traffic-weighted average SNR metrics and formulate two traffic-aware deployment problems: (i) maximizing the traffic-weighted network average SNR, and (ii) a fairness-oriented traffic-restricted max--min average-SNR design over traffic-dominant grids. To solve these nonconvex problems with low complexity, we reveal and exploit their separable structures. For the network-average objective, we establish unimodality properties of the hotspot-induced components and develop a candidate-based global maximization method that only needs to evaluate the objective at a small set of candidate antenna positions. For the traffic-restricted max--min objective, we develop a block coordinate decent framework where each coordinate update reduces to a globally solvable one-dimensional subproblem via an epigraph reformulation and bisection. Simulations show that traffic-aware pinching-antenna positioning consistently outperforms representative fixed and heuristic traffic-aware deployments in the considered setups.

Abstract: This two-part paper aims to develop an environment-aware network-level design framework for generalized pinching-antenna systems to overcome the limitations of conventional link-level optimization, which is tightly coupled to instantaneous user geometry and thus sensitive to user mobility and localization errors. Part I investigates the traffic-aware case, where user presence is characterized statistically by a spatial traffic map and deployments are optimized using traffic-aware network-level metrics. Part II complements Part I by developing geometry-aware, blockage-aware network optimization for pinching-antenna systems in obstacle-rich environments. We introduce a grid-level average signal-to-noise (SNR) model with a deterministic LoS visibility indicator and a discrete activation architecture, where the geometry-dependent terms are computed offline in advance. Building on this model, we formulate two network-level activation problems: (i) average-SNR-threshold coverage maximization and (ii) fairness-oriented worst-grid average-SNR maximization. On the algorithmic side, we prove the coverage problem is NP-hard and derive an equivalent mix-integer linear programming reformulation through binary coverage variables and linear SNR linking constraints. To achieve scalability, we further develop a structure-exploiting coordinate-ascent method that updates one waveguide at a time using precomputed per-candidate SNR contributions. For the worst-grid objective, we adopt an epigraph reformulation and leverage the resulting monotone feasibility in the target SNR, enabling an efficient bisection-based solver with low-complexity feasibility checks over the discrete candidate set. Simulations results validate the proposed designs and quantify their gains under different environments and system parameters.

Abstract: Remote and resource-constrained Internet-of-Things (IoT) deployments often lack terrestrial connectivity for task offloading, motivating non-terrestrial networks (NTNs) with onboard multiaccess edge computing (MEC) capabilities. Nevertheless, in the presence of malicious actors, authentication needs to be performed to avoid non-authorized nodes from draining the computing resources of the NTN nodes. As a solution, we propose a four-layer MEC-enabled NTN with unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) acting as access nodes, a high altitude platform station (HAPS) acting as coordinator and authenticator, and a constellation of low-Earth orbit satellites (LEOSats) acting as remote MEC servers. We consider a tag-based physical-layer authentication (PLA) scheme to authenticate legitimate users, and formulate a joint task offloading decision and resource allocation for the admitted tasks, which is solved via block coordinate descent. Numerical results show that the PLA scheme is efficient and performs better than the benchmark schemes. We also demonstrate that the proposed scheme is robust against malicious attacks even under relaxed false-alarm constraints.

Abstract: Near-field ultra-massive MIMO (U-MIMO) systems provide enhanced spatial resolution but present challenges for channel estimation, particularly when hybrid architectures are employed. Within this framework, dictionary-based channel estimation schemes are needed to achieve accurate reconstruction from a reduced set of measurements. However, existing near-field dictionaries generally provide full three-dimensional coverage, which is unnecessary when user equipments are primarily located on the ground. In this paper, we propose a novel near-field grid design tailored to this common scenario. Specifically, grid points lie on a reference plane located at an arbitrary height with respect to the U-MIMO system, equipped with a uniform planar array. Furthermore, a channel accuracy metric is used to improve codebook performance, and to remark the limitations of the traditional far-field angular sampling in the near field. Results show that, as long as user equipments are not far from the reference plane, the proposed grid outperforms state-of-the-art designs in both channel estimation accuracy and spectral efficiency.

To decouple the passively combined uplink signal and to provide per-segment observability, tagged pilots are employed. A simple tag is attached to each segment and is used to apply a known low-rate modulation at the segment feed, which assigns a unique signature to each segment. Based on the tagged-pilot model, a low-complexity per-segment maximum-likelihood (ML) detector is developed for the case in which the pilot length is no smaller than the number of segments. For the case in which the pilot length is smaller than the number of segments, sparsity in the failure-indicator vector is exploited and a compressive sensing-based detector is adopted. Numerical results show that the per-segment detector approaches joint ML performance, while the compressive sensing-based detector achieves reliable detection with a short pilot and can outperform baselines that require much longer pilots.

Abstract: This study investigates a robust reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system for secure wireless communication, in which a multi-antenna transmitter (Alice) sends confidential messages to a multi-antenna receiver (Bob) in the presence of an eavesdropper (Eve). Unlike idealized models, the reflecting elements (REs) of the RIS are assumed to possess inherent electrical resistance, introducing a practical non-ideal effect often neglected in prior research. The aim of the study is to maximize the secrecy rate of the MIMO system under perfect knowledge of the channel state information (CSI). To achieve this, the secrecy rate maximization problem is formulated and solved using a low-complexity joint optimization framework based on an adaptive projected gradient method (PGM), which simultaneously updates both the transmit precoding matrix and the RIS phase shifts. Solving the exact problem is computationally complex. Thus, a simplified variant is further introduced that maximizes the channel power difference rather than the exact secrecy rate. The simulation results show that this approximation yields a secrecy rate close to the true optimum while significantly reducing the computational cost. In addition, the proposed PGM with an adaptive step size initialization and control mechanism substantially improves the secrecy rate and reduces the computational time compared to the conventional fixed step size PGM. Overall, the simulation results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed PGM and demonstrate that adopting a practical RIS model is essential for establishing secure RIS-assisted MIMO communication links, especially under varying RE resistance values.

Abstract: Uniform quantization is a topic that has been extensively studied. However and although an analytical description of quantization noise has been proposed, most descriptions of the spectral properties of quantization error resort to statistical descriptions. In this paper, we show how the spectrum of a quantized signal can be expressed using pulse frequency modulation. We first establish the equivalence of a uniform quantizer with a system based on the bipolar pulse frequency modulation and we define afterwards the Fourier transform of the quantized signal using pulse frequency modulation properties. This model brings a more intuitive understanding of the spectral structure of quantization noise and complements prior research in the topic. The results of the paper can be directly applied to level crossing ADCs with zero-order-hold interpolators, giving an accurate estimation of their performance.

Abstract: Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is a tomographic sensor that measures 2D slices of the 3D spatial Fourier transform of the scene. In many operational scenarios, the measured set of 2D slices does not fill the 3D space in the Fourier domain, resulting in significant artifacts in the reconstructed imagery. Traditionally, simple priors, such as sparsity in the image domain, are used to regularize the inverse problem. In this paper, we review our recent work that achieves state-of-the-art results in 3D SAR imaging employing neural structures to model the surface scattering that dominates SAR returns. These neural structures encode the surface of the objects in the form of a signed distance function learned from the sparse scattering data. Since estimating a smooth surface from a sparse and noisy point cloud is an ill-posed problem, we regularize the surface estimation by sampling points from the implicit surface representation during the training step. We demonstrate the model's ability to represent target scattering using measured and simulated data from single vehicles and a larger scene with a large number of vehicles. We conclude with future research directions calling for methods to learn complex-valued neural representations to enable synthesizing new collections from the volumetric neural implicit representation.

Abstract: Regulatory limits on Maximum Permissible Exposure (MPE) require handheld devices to reduce transmit power when operated near the user's body. Current proximity sensors provide only binary detection, triggering conservative power back-off that degrades link quality. If the device could measure its distance from the body, transmit power could be adjusted proportionally, improving throughput while maintaining compliance. This paper develops a device-centric integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) method for the device to measure this distance. The uplink communication waveform is exploited for sensing, and the natural motion of the user's hand creates a virtual aperture that provides the angular resolution necessary for localization. Virtual aperture processing requires precise knowledge of the device trajectory, which in this scenario is opportunistic and unknown. One can exploit onboard inertial sensors to estimate the device trajectory; however, the inertial sensors accuracy is not sufficient. To address this, we develop an autofocus algorithm based on extended Kalman filtering that jointly tracks the trajectory and compensates residual errors using phase observations from strong scatterers. The Bayesian Cramér-Rao bound for localization is derived under correlated inertial errors. Numerical results at 28GHz demonstrate centimeter-level accuracy with realistic sensor parameters.

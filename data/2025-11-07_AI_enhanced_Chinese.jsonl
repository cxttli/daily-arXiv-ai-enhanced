In particular, with the proposed\npinching-antenna-assisted EDMA, the multi-user propagation environment is\nintelligently reconfigured to improve signal strength at intended receivers and\nsimultaneously suppress multiple-access interference, without requiring complex\nsignal processing, e.g., precoding, beamforming, or multi-user detection. The\nkey to creating a favorable propagation environment is to utilize the\ncapability of pinching antennas to reconfigure line-of-sight (LoS) links, e.g.,\npinching antennas are placed at specific locations, such that interference\nlinks are blocked on purpose. Based on a straightforward choice of\npinching-antenna locations, the ergodic sum-rate gain of EDMA over conventional\nmultiple access and the probability that EDMA achieves a larger instantaneous\nsum rate than the considered benchmarking scheme are derived in closed form.\nThe obtained analytical results demonstrate the significant potential of EDMA\nfor supporting multi-user communications. Furthermore, pinching antenna\nlocation optimization is also investigated, since the locations of pinching\nantennas are critical for reconfiguring LoS links and large-scale path losses.\nTwo low-complexity algorithms are developed for uplink and downlink\ntransmission, respectively, and simulation results are provided to show their\noptimality in comparison to exhaustive searches.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u7684\u73af\u5883\u5206\u5272\u591a\u5740\uff08EDMA\uff09\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7pinching\u5929\u7ebf\u667a\u80fd\u91cd\u6784\u4f20\u64ad\u73af\u5883\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u4fe1\u53f7\u5e76\u6291\u5236\u5e72\u6270\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u590d\u6742\u4fe1\u53f7\u5904\u7406\u5373\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u591a\u7528\u6237\u901a\u4fe1\u3002", "motivation": "\u5229\u7528\u65e0\u7ebf\u4f20\u64ad\u73af\u5883\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u7279\u6027\u4f5c\u4e3a\u65b0\u7684\u591a\u5740\u6280\u672f\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u907f\u514d\u4f20\u7edf\u591a\u5740\u6280\u672f\u6240\u9700\u7684\u590d\u6742\u4fe1\u53f7\u5904\u7406\uff08\u5982\u9884\u7f16\u7801\u3001\u6ce2\u675f\u6210\u5f62\u6216\u591a\u7528\u6237\u68c0\u6d4b\uff09\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u6709\u6548\u652f\u6301\u591a\u7528\u6237\u901a\u4fe1\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8epinching-antenna-assisted\u7684\u73af\u5883\u5206\u5272\u591a\u5740\uff08EDMA\uff09\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7f6e\u653e\u7f6epinching\u5929\u7ebf\u6765\u667a\u80fd\u91cd\u65b0\u914d\u7f6e\u591a\u7528\u6237\u4f20\u64ad\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u91cd\u6784\u89c6\u8ddd\u94fe\u8def\uff0c\u6545\u610f\u963b\u6321\u5e72\u6270\u94fe\u8def\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u6539\u5584\u76ee\u6807\u63a5\u6536\u673a\u7684\u4fe1\u53f7\u5f3a\u5ea6\u540c\u65f6\u6291\u5236\u591a\u5740\u5e72\u6270\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u590d\u6742\u7684\u4fe1\u53f7\u5904\u7406\u3002", "result": "\u63a8\u5bfc\u4e86EDMA\u76f8\u5bf9\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u591a\u5740\u6280\u672f\u7684\u904d\u5386\u548c\u901f\u7387\u589e\u76ca\u7684\u95ed\u5f0f\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e86EDMA\u6bd4\u57fa\u51c6\u65b9\u6848\u83b7\u5f97\u66f4\u5927\u77ac\u65f6\u548c\u901f\u7387\u7684\u6982\u7387\uff0c\u4eff\u771f\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\u6240\u5f00\u53d1\u7684\u4f4e\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u63a5\u8fd1\u7a77\u4e3e\u641c\u7d22\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u89e3\u3002", "conclusion": "EDMA\u6280\u672f\u5177\u6709\u652f\u6301\u591a\u7528\u6237\u901a\u4fe1\u7684\u663e\u8457\u6f5c\u529b\uff0cpinching\u5929\u7ebf\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\u4f18\u5316\u5bf9\u4e8e\u91cd\u6784\u89c6\u8ddd\u94fe\u8def\u548c\u63a7\u5236\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8def\u5f84\u635f\u8017\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u4f4e\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u63a5\u8fd1\u7a77\u4e3e\u641c\u7d22\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u89e3\u3002"}}

We demonstrate that both\nLCR and VS depend on how similarities are scaled and introduce the concept of\n``half distance'' to parameterize this dependence. We prove that VS provides an\nupper bound on LCR for several values of the R\\'enyi-Hill order parameter and\nconjecture that this bound holds for all values. We conclude that VS is\npreferable only when interpreting elements as linear combinations of a more\nfundamental set of ``ur-elements'' or when the system or dataset possesses a\nquantum-mechanical character.

This research presents a prompt-conditioned PSI compression system that\nintegrates prompt learning inspired by large models into the PSI compression\nprocess to address these difficulties. A hybrid prompt technique that\nintegrates soft prompt concatenation with feature-wise linear modulation (FiLM)\nfacilitates adaptive encoding across diverse signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs),\nfading kinds, and compression ratios. Furthermore, a variable rate technique\nincorporates the compression ratio into the prompt embeddings through latent\nmasking, enabling a singular model to adeptly balance reconstruction accuracy.\nAdditionally, a lightweight depthwise convolutional gating (DWCG) decoder\nfacilitates precise feature reconstruction with minimal complexity.\nComprehensive simulations indicate that the proposed framework significantly\nreduces NMSE compared to traditional autoencoder baselines, while ensuring\nrobustness across various channel circumstances and accommodating variable\ncompression ratios within a single model. These findings underscore the\nframework's promise as a scalable and efficient solution for real-time IRS\ncontrol in next-generation wireless networks.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

While DCQCN provides a\nscalable traffic rate adjustment for congesting flows at end nodes (which is\nslow) and CI effectively isolates these flows in special network resources\n(which requires extra logic in the switches), their combined use, although it\ndiminishes their particular drawbacks, leads to false congestion scenarios\nidentification and signaling, excessive throttling, and inefficient network\nresource utilization. In this paper, we propose a new CI mechanism, called\nImproved Congestion Isolation (ICI), which efficiently combines CI and DCQCN so\nthat the information of the isolated congesting flows is used to guide the ECN\nmarking performed by DCQCN in a way that victim flows do not end up being\nmarked.

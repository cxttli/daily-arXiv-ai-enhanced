Using a multi-year spectrum measurement campaign in an outdoor urban environment, power spectral density snapshots are collected over the 89 MHz--6 GHz range. Three altitude-dependent spectral metrics are extracted: band-average power, spectral entropy, and spectral sparsity. We introduce the Altitude-Dependent Spectral Structure Model (ADSSM) to characterize the spectral power and entropy using first-order altitude-domain differential equations, and spectral sparsity using a logistic function, yielding closed-form expressions with physically consistent asymptotic behavior. The model is fitted to altitude-binned measurements from three annual campaigns at the AERPAW testbed across six licensed and unlicensed sub-6 GHz bands. Across all bands and years, the ADSSM achieves low root-mean-square error and high coefficients of determination. Results indicate that power transitions occur over narrow low-altitude regions, while entropy and sparsity evolve over broader, band-dependent altitude ranges, demonstrating that altitude-dependent spectrum behavior is inherently multidimensional. By explicitly modeling altitude-dependent transitions in spectral structure beyond received power, the proposed framework enables spectrum-aware UAV sensing and band selection decisions that are not achievable with conventional power- or threshold-based occupancy models."}

Specifically, it achieves simultaneous optimization across global modules of uplink AI/ML-based joint source-channel coding with modulation, and downlink AI/ML-based modulation with precoding and corresponding data detection, reducing traditional inter-module information barriers to facilitate end-to-end optimization toward global objectives. Moreover, multiple enhancement mechanisms are also proposed, including i) an AI/ML-based cross-layer modulation approach with theoretical analysis for downlink transmission that breaks the isolation of inter-layer features to expand the solution space for determining improved constellation, ii) a utility-oriented precoder construction method that shifts the role of the AI/ML-based CSI feedback decoder from recovering the original CSI to directly generating precoding matrices aiming to improve end-to-end performance, and iii) incorporating modulation into AI/ML-based CSI feedback to bypass bit-level bottlenecks that introduce quantization errors, non-differentiable gradients, and limitations in constellation solution spaces. Furthermore, AI/ML based control agents for optimized transmission schemes are proposed that leverage AI/ML to perform model switching according to channel state, thereby enabling integrated control for global throughput optimization. Finally, simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed solutions in terms of BLER and throughput. These extensive simulations employ more practical assumptions that are aligned with the requirements of the 3GPP, which hopefully provides valuable insights for future standardization discussions."}

However, scaling the number of coordinated nodes introduces challenges in feature extraction from large datasets, and transparent data fusion. We propose an end-to-end framework that operates directly on raw radar data. Each radar node employs a lightweight 2D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to extract local features. A self-attention fusion block then models inter-node relationships and performs adaptive information fusion. Local feature extraction reduces the input dimensionality by up to 480x. This significantly lowers communication overhead and latency. The attention mechanism provides inherent interpretability by quantifying the contribution of each radar node. A hybrid supervised contrastive loss further improves feature separability, especially for fine-grained and imbalanced activity classes. Experiments on real-world distributed Ultra Wide Band (UWB) radar data demonstrate that the proposed method reduces model complexity by 70.8\\%, while achieving higher average accuracy than baseline approaches. Overall, the framework enables transparent, efficient, and low-overhead distributed radar sensing."}

Traditionally, pragmatic compromises are made, such as selecting an optimal subset of parameters for estimation and fixing non-influential parameters. Kalman filters are typically used for dynamical state tracking, to facilitate the control u at every time step. However, for the purpose of parameter estimation, this constraint no longer applies. Our modification has transformed the utility of UKF for the parameter estimation purpose, including minimally influential parameters, with excellent robustness (i.e., under severe noise corruption, challenging patho-physiology, and no prior knowledge of parameter distributions). The modified UKF algorithm is robust in recovering almost all parameters to over 98% accuracy, over 90% of the time, with a challenging target data set of 50, 10-parameter samples. We compare this to the original implementation of the UKF algorithm for parameter estimation and demonstrate a significant improvement."}

To address this, the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has mandated that no single UPI app should exceed 30 percent of total transaction volume. Enforcing this cap, however, poses a significant computational challenge: how to redistribute user transactions across apps without causing widespread user inconvenience while maintaining capacity limits? In this paper, we formalize this problem as the Minimum Edge Activation Flow (MEAF) problem on a bipartite network of users and apps, where activating an edge corresponds to a new app installation. The objective is to ensure a feasible flow respecting app capacities while minimizing additional activations. We further prove that Minimum Edge Activation Flow is NP-Complete. To address the computational challenge, we propose scalable heuristics, named Decoupled Two-Stage Allocation Strategy (DTAS), that exploit flow structure and capacity reuse. Experiments on large semi-synthetic transaction network data show that DTAS finds solutions close to the optimal ILP within seconds, offering a fast and practical way to enforce transaction caps fairly and efficiently."}

Radio Frequency Fingerprinting (RFF) exploits device-specific, hard-to-forge physical-layer impairments for identification, and is promising for IoT and unmanned systems. In practice, however, new devices continuously join deployed systems while per-class training data are limited. Conventional static training and naive replay of stored exemplars are impractical due to growing class cardinality, storage cost, and privacy concerns.\n  We propose an exemplar-free class-incremental learning framework tailored to RFF recognition. Starting from a pretrained feature extractor, we freeze the backbone during incremental stages and train only a classifier together with lightweight Adapter modules that perform small task-specific feature adjustments. For each class we fit a diagonal Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) to the backbone features and sample pseudo-features from these fitted distributions to rehearse past classes without storing raw signals. To improve robustness under few-shot conditions we introduce a time-domain random-masking augmentation and adopt a multi-teacher distillation scheme to compress stage-wise Adapters into a single inference Adapter, trading off accuracy and runtime efficiency.\n  We evaluate the method on large, self-collected ADS-B datasets: the backbone is pretrained on 2,175 classes and incremental experiments are run on a disjoint set of 669 classes with multiple rounds and step sizes. Against several representative baselines, our approach consistently yields higher average accuracy and lower forgetting, while using substantially less storage and avoiding raw-data retention.\n  The proposed pipeline is reproducible and provides a practical, low-storage solution for RFF deployment in resource- and privacy-constrained environments."}

However, conventional handover triggers based on instantaneous channel measurements are prone to failures and the ping-pong effect due to outdated or inaccurate channel state information. To address this, we introduce Deep-SIC, a knowledge-based channel prediction model that employs a Transformer-based approach to predict channel quality and optimise handover decisions. Deep-SIC is a unique model that utilises Partially Decoded Data (PDD), a byproduct of successive interference cancellation (SIC) in NOMA, as a feedback signal to improve its predictions continually. This special purpose enables learners to learn quickly and stabilise their learning. Our model learns 68\\% faster than existing state-of-the-art algorithms, such as Graph-NOMA, while offering verifiable guarantees of stability and resilience to user mobility (Theorem~2). When simulated at the system level, it can be shown that our strategy can substantially enhance network performance: the handover failure rate can be reduced by up to 40\\%, and the ping-pong effect can be mitigated, especially at vehicular speeds (e.g., 60 km/h). Moreover, Deep-SIC has a 20\\% smaller normalised root mean square error (NRMSE) in low-SNR situations than state-of-the-art algorithms with linear computational complexity, $O(K)$.

In these scenarios, rapid variations caused by Doppler spread and time varying multipath propagation lead to fast channel decorrelation, making conventional pilot based channel estimation methods prone to outdated channel state information (CSI) and excessive overhead. Therefore, reliable channel prediction methods become essential to support robust detection and decoding in OTFS systems. In this paper, we propose conditional variational autoencoder for channel prediction (CVAE4CP) method, which learns the conditional distribution of OTFS delay Doppler channel coefficients given physical system and mobility parameters. By incorporating these parameters as conditioning information, the proposed method enables the prediction of future channel coefficients before their actual realization, while accounting for inherent channel uncertainty through a low dimensional latent representation. The proposed framework is evaluated through extensive simulations under high mobility conditions. Numerical results demonstrate that CVAE4CP consistently outperforms a competing learning based baseline in terms of normalized mean squared error (NMSE), particularly at high Doppler frequencies and extended prediction horizons. These results confirm the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed approach for channel prediction in rapidly time varying OTFS systems."}

The conventional methods, i.e., the fractional programming (FP) method and the weighted minimum mean square error (WMMSE) algorithm, can be computationally demanding for two reasons: (i) they require inverting a sequence of matrices whose sizes are proportional to the number of antennas; (ii) they require tuning a set of Lagrange multipliers to account for the power constraints. The recently proposed method called the reduced WMMSE addresses the above two issues for a single cell. In contrast, for the multicell case, another recent method called the FastFP eliminates the large matrix inversion and the Lagrange multipliers by using an improved FP technique, but the update stepsize in the FastFP can be difficult to decide. As such, we propose integrating the deep unfolding network into the FastFP for the stepsize optimization.

Manual navigation of these complex documents is labor-intensive and error-prone, slowing system design, integration, and deployment. To address this challenge, we adopt Contextual Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Contextual RAG), a strategy in which candidate answer choices guide document retrieval and chunk-specific context to improve large language model (LLM) performance. This improvement over traditional RAG achieves more targeted and context-aware retrieval, which improves the relevance of documents passed to the LLM, particularly when the query alone lacks sufficient context for accurate grounding. Our framework is designed for dynamic domains where data evolves rapidly and models must be continuously updated or redeployed, all without requiring LLM fine-tuning. We evaluate this framework using the ORANBenchmark-13K dataset, and compare three LLMs, namely, Llama3.2, Qwen2.5-7B, and Qwen3.0-4B, across both Direct Question Answering (Direct Q&A) and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting strategies. We show that Contextual RAG consistently improves accuracy over standard RAG and base prompting, while maintaining competitive runtime and CO2 emissions.

We demonstrate that the distribution-agnostic definition of the DP framework often mandates excessive noise. To address this, we incorporate an assumption about the prior distribution by lower-bounding the probability of any single record belonging to any specific class. With this assumption, we derive a tight, context-aware leakage bound for general linear queries, and prove that our derived bound is strictly tighter than the standard DP guarantee and converges to the DP guarantee as this probability lower bound approaches zero.

Moreover, base station (BS) placement is a crucial task in the network design, where satisfying coverage requirements is essential. To address these, based on our previous work, we first propose a conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN) that predicts location specific received signal strength (RSS), and EMF exposure simultaneously from the network topology, as images. As a network designing application, we propose a Deep Q Network (DQN) framework, using the trained cGAN, for optimal base station (BS) deployment in the network. Compared to conventional ray tracing simulations, the proposed cGAN reduces inference and deployment time from several hours to seconds. Unlike a standalone cGAN, which provides static performance maps, the proposed GAN-DQN framework enables sequential decision making under coverage and exposure constraints, learning effective deployment strategies that directly solve the BS placement problem. Thus making it well suited for real time design and adaptation in dynamic scenarios in order to satisfy pre defined network specific heterogeneous performance goals."}

We introduce a physics-informed, mean-only stochastic-geometry model of aggregate interference to altitude-binned received power, yielding three interpretable parameters for a given band and campaign: 1) line-of-sight transition slope, 2) transition altitude, and 3) effective activity constant. Analysis of aerial spectrum measurements collected from 2023 to 2025 across multiple sub-6 GHz bands reveals that downlink (DL) and shared-access bands preserve a persistent geometry-driven altitude structure that is stable across years. In contrast, uplink (UL) bands exhibit weak altitude dependence with no identifiable transition, indicating that interference is dominated by activity dynamics rather than propagation geometry. To quantify the practical limits of model reuse, we evaluate a minimal-calibration method in which the transition altitude is fixed from a reference year and the remaining parameters are estimated from only two altitude bins in the target year. The results further indicate that the proposed approach provides accurate predictions for DL and CBRS bands, suggesting the feasibility of low-cost model transfer in stable environments, while highlighting the reduced applicability of mean-field models for UL scenarios."}

However, the inherent topology dynamics of low earth orbit satellite networks and the uncertain network scales bring an inevitable requirement that resource chains for E2E service provisioning must be efficiently re-planned. Therefore, achieving highly adaptive resource management is of great significance in practical deployment applications. This paper first designs a regional resource management (RRM) mode and further formulates the RRM problem that can provide a unified decision space independent of the network scale. Subsequently, leveraging the RRM mode and deep reinforcement learning framework, we develop a topology feature-based dynamic and adaptive resource management algorithm to combat the varying network scales. The proposed algorithm successfully takes into account the fixed output dimension of the neural network and the changing resource chains for E2E service provisioning. The matched design of the service orientation information and phased reward function effectively improves the service performance of the algorithm under the RRM mode.

This work presents Eco-WakeLoc, designed to achieve centimeter-level UWB localization while remaining energy-neutral by combining ultra-low power wake-up radios (WuRs) with solar energy harvesting. By activating anchor nodes only on demand, the proposed system eliminates constant energy consumption while achieving centimeter-level positioning accuracy. To reduce coordination overhead and improve scalability, Eco-WakeLoc employs cooperative localization where active tags initiate ranging exchanges (trilateration), while passive tags opportunistically reuse these messages for TDOA positioning. An additive-increase/multiplicative-decrease (AIMD)-based energy-aware scheduler adapts localization rates according to the harvested energy, thereby maximizing the overall performance of the sensor network while ensuring long-term energy neutrality. The measured energy consumption is only 3.22mJ per localization for active tags, 951uJ for passive tags, and 353uJ for anchors. Real-world deployment on a quadruped robot with nine anchors confirms the practical feasibility, achieving an average accuracy of 43cm in dynamic indoor environments. Year-long simulations show that tags achieve an average of 2031 localizations per day, retaining over 7% battery capacity after one year -- demonstrating that the RTLS achieves sustained energy-neutral operation. Eco-WakeLoc demonstrates that high-accuracy indoor localization can be achieved at scale without continuous infrastructure operation, combining energy neutrality, cooperative positioning, and adaptive scheduling."}

By tightly coupling radio sensing with communication functions, ISAC unlocks new capabilities for situational awareness, localization, tracking, and network adaptation. At the same time, the increasing scale, heterogeneity, and dynamics of future wireless systems demand self-organizing network intelligence capable of autonomously managing resources, topology, and services. Artificial intelligence (AI), particularly learning-driven and data-centric methods, has become a key enabler for realizing this vision. This survey provides a comprehensive and system-level review of AI-native ISAC-enabled self-organizing wireless networks. We develop a unified taxonomy that spans: (i) ISAC signal models and sensing modalities, (ii) network state abstraction and perception from sensing-aware radio data, (iii) learning-driven self-organization mechanisms for resource allocation, topology control, and mobility management, and (iv) cross-layer architectures integrating sensing, communication, and network intelligence. We further examine emerging learning paradigms, including deep reinforcement learning, graph-based learning, multi-agent coordination, and federated intelligence that enable autonomous adaptation under uncertainty, mobility, and partial observability. Practical considerations such as sensing-communication trade-offs, scalability, latency, reliability, and security are discussed alongside representative evaluation methodologies and performance metrics.

Enhancing the ability to transmit medical images and data from rural areas to urban hospitals via wireless networks is critical. However, bandwidth limitations, unreliable networks, and concerns over data security and privacy hinder efficient transmission. Additionally, the high data volume of medical content and the limited battery life of IoT devices pose further challenges. To address these challenges, data compression techniques such as Autoencoders (AEs) offer promising solutions by significantly reducing the communication overhead without sacrificing essential image quality or details. Additionally, spectrum allocation mechanisms in rural areas are often inefficient, leading to poor resource utilization. Auction theory presents a dynamic and adaptive approach to optimize spectrum allocation. This paper proposes a novel hybrid framework that integrates AE-based data compression with auction-based spectrum allocation, addressing both communication efficiency and spectrum utilization in rural wireless networks. Extensive simulations validate the framework's ability to improve spectrum utilization, transmission efficiency, and overall connectivity, offering a practical solution for enhancing rural telemedicine infrastructure."}

We are motivated by the problem of load-balancing in large-scale LEO satellite networks, which can be modelled as a torus, where the traffic is known to be sparse and localized to certain hotspot areas.

Among the various approaches, Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) protocols have been widely adopted for their structured and collision-free communication capabilities. Nevertheless, despite extensive research in this area, current solutions often exhibit suboptimal performance, particularly in dynamic environments where node activity levels fluctuate over time.\n  This paper introduces a novel fully distributed TDMA-based scheduling protocol that intelligently maximizes the utilization of communication resources. The proposed approach adaptively reallocates underutilized time slots, originally assigned to temporarily inactive nodes, to those experiencing higher communication demands. This dynamic reallocation not only improves channel utilization but also reduces idle periods, thereby enhancing overall network efficiency. To further enhance performance, we incorporate a lightweight probabilistic mechanism that governs the temporal leasing of unused slots. This mechanism balances the trade-off between slot availability and transmission reliability, minimizing packet loss while preserving fairness and stability within the network.\n  Simulations across a range of network scenarios demonstrate that our protocol significantly improves throughput, latency, and reliability in resource-constrained environments. These results highlight the protocol's potential as a robust and scalable solution for adaptive and energy-efficient scheduling in next-generation IoT networks."}

Abstract: Deploying fiber optics as a last-mile solution in rural areas is not economically viable due to low population density. Nevertheless, providing high-speed internet access in these regions is essential to promote digital inclusion. 5G Fixed Wireless Access (5G FWA) has emerged as a promising alternative; however, its one-hop topology limits coverage. To overcome this limitation, a multi-hop architecture is required. This work proposes a unified multi-hop framework that integrates long-haul microwave, Integrated Access and Backhaul (IAB), and FWA to provide wide coverage and high capacity in rural areas. As the number of hops increases, total energy consumption also rises, a challenge often overlooked in existing literature. To address this, we propose an energy-efficient multi-radio microwave and IAB-based FWA framework for rural area connectivity. When the network is underutilized, the proposed approach dynamically operates at reduced capacity to minimize energy consumption. We optimize the off, start-up, serving, deep sleep, and wake-up sates of microwave radios to balance energy use and satisfying data rate requirements. Additionally, we optimize resource block allocation for IAB-based FWA nodes connected to microwave backhaul. The formulated optimization problems aim to minimize the energy consumption of long-haul microwave and multi-hop IAB-based network while satisfying data rate constraints. These problems are solved using dual decomposition and multi-convex programming, supported by dynamic programming. Simulation results demonstrates

Abstract: Online government services are increasingly regarded as critical national infrastructure. Because these services directly influence public trust, any disruption can have significant societal and political consequences. Yet their supporting infrastructures remain vulnerable to outages from natural disasters, geopolitical tensions, and targeted attacks. Central to their operation is the authoritative Domain Name System (DNS) infrastructure, the single source of truth that maps government domain names to service endpoints. While indispensable, this infrastructure also represents a potential and critical point of system failure. In this paper, we introduce a comprehensive assessment framework with purpose-designed mechanisms to systematically evaluate the operational resilience of authoritative DNS infrastructure supporting government services. Complementing prior studies on website hosting, recursive resolution, and DNS record integrity, our work provides a holistic view of authoritative DNS operation. Our first contribution develops a multi-sourced data schema that characterizes a (government) domain's authoritative DNS infrastructure across four hierarchical levels: physical hosting infrastructure, server functionality, name servers, and individual hosting instances. Using data collected from six representative countries, our second contribution identifies resilience attributes at their finest applicable hierarchy across three operational phases: infrastructure placement, service configuration, and DNS record dispatch. Our method assigns numerical scores to each attribute and aggregates them algorithmically to enable consistent and cross-domain comparisons. We apply our method to government domains in the six countries, highlighting their strengths and weaknesses in authoritative DNS resilience and pinpointing operational practices that require improvement.

Abstract: Understanding where Internet services are hosted, and how users reach them, has captured the interest of government regulators and others concerned with the privacy of data flows. In this paper we focus on government websites -- services which arguably merit a higher expectation of protection against foreign surveillance or interference -- and seek to identify countries in the middle (CitMs): countries that are neither the source nor destination in a path for a resident visiting their online government services. Finding these CitMs raises daunting methodological challenges. We propose a framework to identify CitMs and use a pilot study of 149 countries to refine our methodology before conducting an in-depth measurement study of 11 countries. For our focused study, we compile an extensive set of websites hosting government services and analyze over 9,000 IP-level paths from vantage points in those countries to these services. We conduct extensive manual validation to corroborate or discard paths based on the aforementioned challenges, and discuss paths that experience unexpected CitMs.

Abstract: Stochastic disruptions such as flash events arising from benign traffic bursts and switch thermal fluctuations are major contributors to intermittent service degradation in software-defined industrial networks. These events violate IEC~61850-derived quality-of-service requirements and user-defined service-level agreements, hindering the reliable and timely delivery of control, monitoring, and best-effort traffic in IEC~61400-25-compliant wind power plants. Failure to maintain these requirements often results in delayed or lost control signals, reduced operational efficiency, and increased risk of wind turbine generator downtime.
  To address these challenges, this study proposes a threshold-triggered Deep Q-Network self-healing agent that autonomically detects, analyzes, and mitigates network disruptions while adapting routing behavior and resource allocation in real time. The proposed agent was trained, validated, and tested on an emulated tri-clustered switch network deployed in a cloud-based proof-of-concept testbed.
  Simulation results show that the proposed agent improves disruption recovery performance by 53.84% compared to a baseline shortest-path and load-balanced routing approach and outperforms state-of-the-art methods, including the Adaptive Network-based Fuzzy Inference System by 13.1% and the Deep Q-Network and traffic prediction-based routing optimization method by 21.5%, in a super-spine leaf data-plane architecture.
  Additionally, the agent maintains switch thermal stability by proactively initiating external rack cooling when required. These findings highlight the potential of deep reinforcement learning in building resilience in software-defined industrial networks deployed in mission-critical, time-sensitive application scenarios.

Abstract: We investigate a forecasting-driven, incentive-compatible service provisioning framework for distributed air-ground integrated edge networks under human-machine coexistence. We consider hybrid players where the computing capacity of edge servers (ESs) are augmented by vehicular-UAV agent pairs (AgPs) that can be proactively dispatched to overloaded hotspots. Unique key challenges should be addressed: highly uncertain spatio-temporal workloads, spatio-temporal coupling between road traffic and UAV capacity, forecast-driven contracting risks, and heterogeneous quality-of-service (QoS) requirements of human users (HuUs) and machine users (MaUs). To cope with these issues, we propose FUSION, a two-stage framework that tightly couples service demand prediction, agent deployment, and task scheduling. In the offline stage, a Pro-LNN module performs intelligent multi-step spatio-temporal demand forecasting at distributed ESs, whose outputs are exploited by an enhanced ant colony optimization-based routing scheme (eACO-VRP) and an auction-based incentive-compatible contracting mechanism (Off-AIC^2), to jointly determine ES-AgP contracts and pre-planned service routes. In the online stage, we formulate congestion-aware task scheduling as an potential game among HuUs, MaUs, and heterogeneous ES/UAV providers, and devise a potential-guided best-response dynamics (PG-BR) algorithm that provably converges to a pure-strategy Nash equilibrium. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world traces show that FUSION significantly improves social welfare, latency, resource utilization, and robustness compared with state-of-the-art baselines.

Abstract: This paper proposes a U-Net-based autoencoder framework for mitigating interference in communication signals corrupted by noise and diverse interference sources. The approach targets scenarios involving both signal-plus-noise and signal-plus-interference-plus-noise mixtures, including sinusoidal interferers, LFM chirps, QPSK interferers with different sampling rates, and modulated interference such as QAM. The U-Net architecture leverages multiscale feature extraction and skip connections to preserve fine-grained temporal structure while suppressing interference components. Performance is evaluated using bit error rate and compared against conventional cancellation methods. Results show that the proposed method consistently outperforms traditional techniques in low- and mid-SIR regimes, while remaining competitive at high SIRs. Additional experiments examine the autoencoder's behavior under model mismatch conditions such as carrier offset and colored noise. The study demonstrates that multiscale neural architectures provide a flexible and effective platform for interference mitigation across a wide range of interference types.

Abstract: This paper presents a pipeline stage resolved timing characterization of a 32-bit RISC V processor implemented on a 20 nm FPGA and a 7 nm FinFET ASIC platform. A unified analysis framework is introduced that decomposes timing paths into logic, routing, and clocking components and maps them to well-defined pipeline stage transitions. This approach enables systematic comparison of timing behavior across heterogeneous implementation technologies at a microarchitectural level. Using static timing analysis and statistical characterization, the study shows that although both implementations exhibit dominant critical paths in the EX to MEM pipeline transition, their underlying timing mechanisms differ fundamentally. FPGA timing is dominated by routing parasitics and placement dependent variability, resulting in wide slack distributions and sensitivity to routing topology. In contrast, ASIC timing is governed primarily by combinational logic depth and predictable parametric variation across process, voltage, and temperature corners, yielding narrow and stable timing distributions. The results provide quantitative insight into the structural origins of timing divergence between programmable and custom fabrics and demonstrate the effectiveness of pipeline stage resolved analysis for identifying platform specific bottlenecks. Based on these findings, the paper derives design implications for achieving predictable timing closure in processor architectures targeting both FPGA and ASIC implementations.

Abstract: Restoring natural and intuitive hand function requires simultaneous and proportional control (SPC) of multiple degrees of freedom (DoFs). This study systematically evaluated the multichannel linear descriptors-based block field method (MLD-BFM) for continuous decoding of five finger-joint DoFs by leveraging the rich spatial information of high-density surface electromyography (HD sEMG). Twenty-one healthy participants performed dynamic sinusoidal finger movements while HD sEMG signals were recorded from the \textit{extensor digitorum communis} (EDC) and \textit{flexor digitorum superficialis} (FDS) muscles. MLD-BFM extracted region-specific spatial features, including effective field strength ($Σ$), field-strength variation rate ($Φ$), and spatial complexity ($Ω$). Model performance was optimized (block size: $2 \times 2$; window: 0.15 s) and compared with conventional time-domain features and dimensionality reduction approaches when applied to multi-output regression models. MLD-BFM consistently achieved the highest $\mathrm{R}^2_{\mathrm{vw}}$ values across all models. The multilayer perceptron (MLP) combined with MLD-BFM yielded the best performance ($\mathrm{R}^2_{\mathrm{vw}} = 86.68\% \pm 0.33$). Time-domain features also showed strong predictive capability and were statistically comparable to MLD-BFM in some models, whereas dimensionality reduction techniques exhibited lower accuracy. Decoding accuracy was higher for the middle and ring fingers than for the thumb. Overall, MLD-BFM improved continuous finger movement decoding accuracy, underscoring the importance of taking advantage of the spatial richness of HD sEMG. These findings suggest that spatially structured features enhance SPC and provide practical guidance for designing robust, real-time, and responsive myoelectric interfaces.

Abstract: In this letter, we investigate the fundamental limits of localization in fluid antenna systems (FAS) utilizing a Fisher-information-theoretic framework. We develop a unified model to quantify the localization information extractable from time-of-arrival (ToA) and angle-of-arrival (AoA) measurements, explicitly capturing the synthetic aperture effects induced by FAS. Closed-form expressions are derived for the equivalent Fisher information matrix (EFIM) and the corresponding positioning error bound (PEB) in both user-side and base-station (BS)-side FAS configurations. Also, we propose optimal port-selection strategies based on greedy algorithms and convex relaxation to maximize the information gain under a constrained number of activated ports. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed port-selection schemes can substantially tighten the PEB compared with random activation, thereby confirming the strong potential of FAS to enable high-precision localization. These results offer analytical insights and practical design guidelines for FAS-aided positioning in future-generation wireless networks

Abstract: In this paper, we address the challenge of dynamic spectrum access in a cognitive Internet of Things (CIoT) network where a secondary user (SU) operates under both energy constraints and adversarial interference from a smart jammer. The SU coexists with primary users (PUs) and must ensure that its transmissions do not exceed a predefined interference threshold on licensed channels. At each time slot, the SU must jointly determine whether to transmit or harvest energy, which channel to access, and the appropriate transmit power while satisfying energy and interference constraints. Meanwhile, a smart jammer actively selects a channel to disrupt, aiming to degrade the SU's communication performance. This setting presents a significant challenge due to its multi-level decision structure and hybrid action space, which combines both discrete and continuous decisions. To tackle this, we propose a novel Hierarchical Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (H-DDPG) framework that decomposes the decision-making process into three levels: the high-level policy determines the mode (transmit or harvest), the mid-level policy selects the channel, and the low-level actor outputs a continuous power level. Concurrently, the jammer is modeled as a reinforcement learning agent that learns an adaptive channel jamming strategy using a discrete variant of DDPG. Simulation results show that our H-DDPG approach outperforms conventional flat reinforcement learning baselines.

Abstract: In cognitive Internet of Things (CIoT) networks, efficient spectrum sharing is essential to address increasing wireless demands. This paper presents a novel deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based approach for joint cooperative caching and spectrum access coordination in CIoT networks, enabling the CIoT agents to collaborate with primary users (PUs) by caching PU content and serving their requests, fostering mutual benefits. The proposed DRL framework jointly optimizes caching policy and spectrum access under challenging conditions. Unlike traditional cognitive radio (CR) methods, where CIoT agents vacate the spectrum for PUs, or relaying techniques, which merely support spectrum sharing, caching brings data closer to the edge, reducing latency by minimizing retrieval distance. Simulations demonstrate that our approach outperforms others in lowering latency, increasing CIoT and PU cache hit rates, and enhancing network throughput. This approach redefines spectrum sharing, offering a fresh perspective on CIoT network design and illustrating the potential of DRL-guided caching to highlight the benefits of collaboration over dynamic spectrum access scenarios, elevating CIoT performance under constrained resources.

Abstract: Rotatable intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRSs) introduce a new degree of freedom (DoF) for shaping wireless propagation by adaptively adjusting the orientation of IRSs. This paper considers an angle-dependent reflection model in a wireless communication system aided by two rotatable IRSs. Specifically, we study the joint design of the base station transmit beamforming, as well as the cooperative passive beamforming and orientation of the two IRSs, to maximize the received signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Under the light-of-sight (LoS) channels, we first develop a particle swarm optimization (PSO) based method to determine the IRS rotation and derive an optimal rotation in a closed-form expression for a two-dimensional IRS deployment. Then, we extend the design to the general Rician fading channels by proposing an efficient alternating optimization and PSO (AO-PSO) algorithm. Numerical results validate the substantial gains achieved by the IRS rotation over fixed-IRS schemes and also demonstrate the superior performance of the double rotatable IRSs over a single rotatable IRS given a sufficient total number of IRS elements.

Abstract: This paper proposes a hierarchical deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework based on the soft actor-critic (SAC) algorithm for hybrid underlay-overlay cognitive Internet of Things (CIoT) networks with simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT)-energy harvesting (EH) and cooperative caching. Unlike prior hierarchical DRL approaches that focus primarily on spectrum access or power control, our work jointly optimizes EH, hybrid access coordination, power allocation, and caching in a unified framework. The joint optimization problem is formulated as a weighted-sum multi-objective task, designed to maximize throughput and cache hit ratio while simultaneously minimizing transmission delay. In the proposed model, CIoT agents jointly optimize EH and data transmission using a learnable time switching (TS) factor. They also coordinate spectrum access under hybrid overlay-underlay paradigms and make power control and cache placement decisions while considering energy, interference, and storage constraints. Specifically, in this work, cooperative caching is used to enable overlay access, while power control is used for underlay access. A novel three-level hierarchical SAC (H-SAC) agent decomposes the mixed discrete-continuous action space into modular subproblems, improving scalability and convergence over flat DRL methods. The high-level policy adjusts the TS factor, the mid-level policy manages spectrum access coordination and cache sharing, and the low-level policy decides transmit power and caching actions for both the CIoT agent and PU content. Simulation results show that the proposed hierarchical SAC approach significantly outperforms benchmark and greedy strategies. It achieves better performance in terms of average sum rate, delay, cache hit ratio, and energy efficiency, even under channel fading and uncertain conditions.

Abstract: Orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) modulation has emerged as a robust solution for high-mobility wireless communications. However, conventional detection algorithms, such as linear equalizers and message passing (MP) methods, either suffer from noise enhancement or fail under complex doubly-selective channels, especially in the presence of fractional delay and Doppler shifts. In this paper, we propose a hybrid low-complexity iterative detection framework that combines linear minimum mean square error (L-MMSE) estimation with MP-based probabilistic inference. The key idea is to apply a new delay-Doppler (DD) commutation precoder (DDCP) to the DD domain signal vector, such that the resulting effective channel matrix exhibits a structured form with several locally dense blocks that are sparsely inter-connected. This precoding structure enables a hybrid iterative detection strategy, where a low-dimensional L-MMSE estimation is applied to the dense blocks, while MP is utilized to exploit the sparse inter-block connections. Furthermore, we provide a detailed complexity analysis, which shows that the proposed scheme incurs lower computational cost compared to the full-size L-MMSE detection. The simulation results of convergence performance confirm that the proposed hybrid MP detection achieves fast and reliable convergence with controlled complexity. In terms of error performance, simulation results demonstrate that our scheme achieves significantly better bit error rate (BER) under various channel conditions. Particularly in multipath scenarios, the BER performance of the proposed method closely approaches the matched filter bound (MFB), indicating its near-optimal error performance.

Abstract: This paper investigates antenna coding based on pixel antennas as a new degree of freedom for enhancing multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) wireless power transfer (WPT) systems. Antenna coding is closely related to the Fluid Antenna System (FAS) concept and further generalizes the radiation pattern reconfigurability. We first introduce a beamspace channel model to demonstrate reconfigurable radiation patterns enabled by antenna coders. By jointly optimizing the antenna coding and transmit beamforming with perfect channel state information (CSI), we exploit gains from antenna coding, transmit beamforming, and rectenna nonlinearity to maximize the output DC power. We adopt an alternating optimization approach with the quasi-Newton method and Successive Exhaustive Boolean Optimization (SEBO) method with warm-start to handle the transmit beamforming design and antenna coding design respectively. Finally, simulation results show that the proposed MIMO WPT system with pixel antennas achieves up to 15 dB gain in average output DC power compared with a conventional system with fixed antenna configuration, highlighting the potential of pixel antennas for boosting the WPT efficiency.

Abstract: In modal analysis, the prevalent use of Gaussian-based wavelets (such as Morlet and Gabor) for damping estimation is rarely questioned. In this study, we challenge this conventional approach by systematically exploring envelope-based damping estimators and proposing a data-driven framework that optimizes the shape and parameters of the envelope utilizing synthetic impulse responses with known ground-truth envelopes. The performance of the resulting estimators is benchmarked across a range of scenarios and compared against frequency-domain damping estimation methods, including Least Squares Rational Function (LSRF), poly-reference Least Squares Complex Frequency-Domain (pLSCF), peak picking (PP), and the Yoshida method. Our findings indicate that Triangle and Welch windows consistently outperform or are on par with Gaussian wavelet methods in contexts of moderate to high signal-to-noise ratios (SNR). In contrast, Blackman filtering demonstrates superior robustness under low SNR conditions and scenarios involving closely spaced modes. Among the frequency-domain methods assessed, LSRF shows the most reliability at very low SNR; however, the non-Gaussian optimized envelope estimators perform exceptionally well as the SNR improves.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose an interpretable denoising method for graph signals using regularization by denoising (RED). RED is a technique developed for image restoration that uses an efficient (and sometimes black-box) denoiser in the regularization term of the optimization problem. By using RED, optimization problems can be designed with the explicit use of the denoiser, and the gradient of the regularization term can be easily computed under mild conditions. We adapt RED for denoising of graph signals beyond image processing. We show that many graph signal denoisers, including graph neural networks, theoretically or practically satisfy the conditions for RED. We also study the effectiveness of RED from a graph filter perspective. Furthermore, we propose supervised and unsupervised parameter estimation methods based on deep algorithm unrolling. These methods aim to enhance the algorithm applicability, particularly in the unsupervised setting. Denoising experiments for synthetic and real-world datasets show that our proposed method improves signal denoising accuracy in mean squared error compared to existing graph signal denoising methods.

Abstract: This letter proposes a novel user localization and channel estimation framework for pinching-antenna systems (PASS), where pinching antennas are grouped into subarrays on each waveguide to cooperatively estimate user/scatterer locations, thus reconstructing channels. Both single-waveguide (SW) and multi-waveguide (MW) structures are considered. SW consists of multiple alternatingly activated subarrays, while MW deploys one subarray on each waveguide to enable concurrent subarray measurements. For the 2D scenarios with a fixed user/scatter height, an orthogonal matching pursuit-based geometry-consistent localization (OMP-GCL) algorithm is proposed, which leverages inter-subarray geometric relationships and compressed sensing for precise estimation. Theoretical analysis on Cramér-Rao lower bound (CRLB) demonstrates that: 1) The estimation accuracy can be improved by increasing the geometric diversity through multi-subarray deployment; and 2) SW provides a limited geometric diversity within a $180^\circ$ half space and leads to angle ambiguity, while MW enables full-space observations and reduces overheads. The OMP-GCL algorithm is further extended to 3D scenarios, where user and scatter heights are also estimated. Numerical results validate the theoretical analysis, and verify that MW achieves centimeter- and decimeter-level localization accuracy in 2D and 3D scenarios with only three waveguides.

Abstract: The sixth-generation (6G) wireless networks promises the integration of radar-like sensing capabilities into communication infrastructure. In this paper, we investigate a multi-static sensing framework where half-duplex base stations (BSs) are assigned as either transmitter or sensing receiver nodes. We propose a randomized sparse resource allocation scheme based on orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) waveform design tailored for the multi-static scenario to simultaneously mitigate inter-BS interference (IBI) and sensing ambiguities. The waveform design also ensures robustness against inter-symbol interference (ISI) and intercarrier interference (ICI) via a judicious choice of subcarrier spacing according to the deployment of BSs. The potential ambiguity caused by sparse signaling is addressed through controlled irregularity in both time and frequency domains, with a negligible noise floor elevation. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness and resilience of the proposed design in the presence of multiple targets and clutter.

Abstract: This work proposes a pragmatic method for the design of beam footprint layouts and beam hopping illumination patterns to efficiently broadcast 3GPP NTN common signaling to large coverage areas using EIRP-limited LEO satellites. This method minimizes the time resources required to sweep over the whole coverage while ensuring that the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio received by users is above a given threshold. It discusses the design of: (i) an Earth-fixed grid of beam layouts; (ii) beamforming vectors and beam power allocation; (iii) beam hopping patterns and (iv) space, time and frequency resource allocation of 3GPP common signaling. Two main beam layout solutions are proposed to significantly reduce the number of beams required to illuminate the coverage area: one based on phased array beams with low beam crossover levels and the other on widened beams. A numerical evaluation using practical system parameters showed that both solutions perform similarly, but that the best result is obtained with phased arrays beams with optimized beam cross over levels. Indeed, for the system evaluated, they allowed reducing the total number of beams from 1723 to 451, which combined with a proper beam hopping pattern and scheduling scheme allowed obtaining a coverage ratio of 100% and a common signaling efficiency (i.e. number of slots carrying common signaling over total number of slots) up to 80.6% for the most stringent common signaling periodicity of 20 ms considered by 3GPP.

Abstract: Terahertz (THz) communication offers ultra-high data rates and has emerged as a promising technology for future wireless networks. However, the inherently high free-space path loss of THz waves significantly limits the coverage range of THz communication systems. Therefore, extending the effective coverage area is a key challenge for the practical deployment of THz networks. Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS), which can dynamically manipulate electromagnetic wave propagation, provide a solution to enhance THz coverage. To investigate multi-RIS deployment scenarios, this work integrates an antenna array-based RIS model into the ray-tracing simulation platform. Using an indoor hall as a representative case study, the enhancement effects of single-hop and dual-hop RIS configurations on indoor signal coverage are evaluated under various deployment schemes. The developed framework offers valuable insights and design references for optimizing RIS-assisted indoor THz communication and coverage estimation.

Abstract: Extended object tracking involves estimating both the physical extent and kinematic parameters of a target object, where typically multiple measurements are observed per time step. In this article, we propose a deterministic closed-form elliptical extended object tracker, based on decoupling of the kinematics, orientation, and axis lengths. By disregarding potential correlations between these state components, fewer approximations are required for the individual estimators than for an overall joint solution. The resulting algorithm outperforms existing algorithms, reaching the accuracy of sampling-based procedures. Additionally, a batch-based variant is introduced, yielding highly efficient computation while outperforming all comparable state-of-the-art algorithms. This is validated both by a simulation study using common models from literature, as well as an extensive quantitative evaluation on real automotive radar data.

Abstract: This paper introduces a sensing-centric joint communication and millimeter-wave radar paradigm to facilitate collaboration among intelligent vehicles.
  We first propose a chirp waveform-based delay-Doppler quadrature amplitude modulation (DD-QAM) that modulates data across delay, Doppler, and amplitude dimensions.
  Building upon this modulation scheme, we derive its achievable rate to quantify the communication performance.
  We then introduce an extended Kalman filter-based scheme for four-dimensional (4D) parameter estimation in dynamic environments, enabling the active vehicles to accurately estimate orientation and tangential-velocity beyond traditional 4D radar systems.
  Furthermore, in terms of communication, we propose a dual-compensation-based demodulation and tracking scheme that allows the passive vehicles to effectively demodulate data without compromising their sensing functions.
  Simulation results underscore the feasibility and superior performance of our proposed methods, marking a significant advancement in the field of autonomous vehicles.

Abstract: In intelligent low-altitude networks, integrating monitoring tasks into communication unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can consume resources and increase handoff latency for communication links. To address this challenge, we propose a strategy that enables a "double use" of UAVs, unifying the monitoring and relay handoff functions into a single, efficient process. Our scheme, guided by an integrated sensing and communication framework, coordinates these multi-role UAVs through a proactive handoff network that fuses multi-view sensory data from aerial and ground vehicles. A lightweight vehicle inspection module and a two-stage training procedure are developed to ensure monitoring accuracy and collaborative efficiency. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of this integrated approach: it reduces communication outage probability by nearly 10% at a 200 Mbps requirement without compromising monitoring performance and maintains high resilience (86% achievable rate) even in the absence of multiple UAVs, outperforming traditional ground-based handoff schemes. Our code is available at the https://github.com/Jiahui-L/UAP.

Abstract: The rapid growth of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in civilian and critical-infrastructure airspace has created a need for reliable detection and tracking systems that operate under diverse environmental and sensing conditions. This paper presents a UAV detection and tracking system that fuses measurements from a network of passive Keysight N6841A RF sensors and a Ku-band Fortem TrueView R20 radar operating in the FR3 spectrum (16.3 GHz) as an ISAC proxy. Real-world experiments at the NSF AERPAW testbed demonstrate that radar and RF sensing provide complementary strengths under varying geometric, range, and line-of-sight conditions. A Kalman filter using a constant-velocity motion model integrates the asynchronous 2D RF and 3D radar observations, suppressing large standalone errors, improving accuracy over individual modalities, and increasing tracking coverage without degrading performance. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of multi-modal, ISAC-oriented sensing for robust UAV tracking in outdoor environments.

Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) for next-generation networks targets robust operation under high mobility and high Doppler spread, leading to severe inter-carrier interference (ICI) in systems based on orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) waveforms. Delay--Doppler (DD)-domain ISAC offers a more robust foundation under high mobility, but it requires a suitable DD-domain pulse-shaping filter. The prevailing DD pulse designs are either communication-centric or static, which limits adaptation to non-stationary channels and diverse application demands. To address this limitation, this paper introduces the tunable Gaussian pulse (TGP), a DD-native, analytically tunable pulse shape parameterized by its aspect ratio \( γ\), chirp rate \( α_c \), and phase coupling \( β_c \). On the sensing side, we derive closed-form Cramér--Rao lower bounds (CRLBs) that map \( (γ,α_c,β_c) \) to fundamental delay and Doppler precision. On the communications side, we show that \( α_c \) and \( β_c \) reshape off-diagonal covariance, and thus inter-symbol interference (ISI), without changing received power, isolating capacity effects to interference structure rather than power loss. A comprehensive trade-off analysis demonstrates that the TGP spans a flexible operational region from the high capacity of the Sinc pulse to the high precision of the root raised cosine (RRC) pulse. Notably, TGP attains near-RRC sensing precision while retaining over \( 90\% \) of Sinc's maximum capacity, achieving a balanced operating region that is not attainable by conventional static pulse designs.

Abstract: Semantic communication systems often use an end-to-end neural network to map input data into continuous symbols. These symbols, which are essentially neural network features, usually have fixed dimensions and heavy-tailed distributions. However, due to the end-to-end training nature of the neural network encoder, the underlying reason for the symbol distribution remains underexplored. We propose a new explanation for the semantic symbol distribution: an inherent trade-off between source coding and communications. Specifically, the encoder balances two objectives: allocating power for minimum \emph{effective codelength} (for source coding) and maximizing mutual information (for communications). We formalize this trade-off via an information-theoretic optimization framework, which yields a Student's $t$-distribution as the resulting symbol distribution. Through extensive studies on image-based semantic systems, we find that our formulation models the learned symbols and predicts how the symbol distribution's shape parameter changes with respect to (i) the use of variable-length coding and (ii) the dataset's entropy variability. Furthermore, we demonstrate how introducing a regularizer that enforces a target symbol distribution, which guides the encoder towards a target prior (e.g., Gaussian), improves training convergence and supports our hypothesis.

Abstract: In this paper, for an odd prime power $q$, we extend the construction of Xie et al. \cite{XOYM2023} to propose two classes of linear codes $\mathcal{C}_{Q}$ and $\mathcal{C}_{Q}'$ over the finite field $\mathbb{F}_{q}$ with at most four nonzero weights. These codes are derived from quadratic forms through a bivariate construction. We completely determine their complete weight enumerators and weight hierarchies by employing exponential sums. Most of these codes are minimal and some are optimal in the sense that they meet the Griesmer bound. Furthermore, we also establish the weight hierarchies of $\mathcal{C}_{Q,N}$ and $\mathcal{C}_{Q,N}'$, which are the descended codes of $\mathcal{C}_{Q}$ and $\mathcal{C}_{Q}'$.

Abstract: This work focuses on the development of an analytical framework to study a diffusion-assisted molecular communication-based network of nano-machines (NMs) with a clustered initial deployment to detect a target in a three-dimensional (3D) medium. Leveraging the Poisson cluster process to model the initial locations of clustered NMs, we derive the analytical expression for the target detection probability with respect to time along with relevant bounds. We also investigate a single-cluster scenario. All the derived expressions are validated through extensive particle-based simulations. Furthermore, we analyze the impact of key parameters, such as the mean number of NMs per cluster, the density of the cluster, and the spatial spread, on the detection performance. Our results show that detection probability is greatly influenced by clustering, and different spatial arrangements produce varying performances. The results offer a better understanding of how molecular communication systems should be designed for optimal target detection in nanoscale and biological environments.

Abstract: Robust beamforming design under imperfect channel state information (CSI) is a fundamental challenge in multiuser multiple-input multiple-output (MU-MIMO) systems, particularly when the channel estimation error statistics are unknown. Conventional model-driven methods usually rely on prior knowledge of the error covariance matrix and data-driven deep learning approaches suffer from poor generalization capability to unseen channel conditions. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a hybrid offline-online framework that achieves effective offline learning and rapid online adaptation. In the offline phase, we propose a shared (among users) deep neural network (DNN) that is able to learn the channel estimation error covariance from observed samples, thus enabling robust beamforming without statistical priors. Meanwhile, to facilitate real-time deployment, we propose a sparse augmented low-rank (SALR) method to reduce complexity while maintaining comparable performance. In the online phase, we show that the proposed network can be rapidly fine-tuned with minimal gradient steps. Furthermore, a multiple basis model-agnostic meta-learning (MB-MAML) strategy is further proposed to maintain multiple meta-initializations and by dynamically selecting the best one online, we can improve the adaptation and generalization capability of the proposed framework under unseen or non-stationary channels. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed offline-online framework exhibits strong robustness across diverse channel conditions and it is able to significantly outperform state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines.

Abstract: The advancement to 6G calls for waveforms that transcend static robustness to achieve intelligent adaptability. Affine Frequency Division Multiplexing (AFDM), despite its strength in doubly-dispersive channels, has been confined by chirp parameters optimized for worst-case scenarios. This paper shatters this limitation with Agile-AFDM, a novel framework that endows AFDM with dynamic, data-aware intelligence. By redefining chirp parameters as optimizable variables for each transmission block based on real-time channel and data information, Agile-AFDM transforms into an adaptive platform. It can actively reconfigure its waveform to minimize peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) for power efficiency, suppress inter-carrier interference (ICI) for communication reliability, or reduce Cramer-Rao bound (CRLB) for sensing accuracy. This paradigm shift from a static, one-size-fits-all waveform to a context-aware signal designer is made practical by efficient, tailored optimization algorithms. Comprehensive simulations demonstrate that this capability delivers significant performance gains across all metrics, surpassing conventional OFDM and static AFDM. Agile-AFDM, therefore, offers a crucial step forward in the design of agile waveforms for 6G and beyond.

Abstract: We consider a denoiser that reconstructs a stationary ergodic source by lossily compressing samples of the source observed through a memoryless noisy channel. Prior work on compression-based denoising has been limited to additive noise channels. We extend this framework to general discrete memoryless channels by deliberately choosing the distortion measure for the lossy compressor to match the channel conditional distribution. By bounding the deviation of the empirical joint distribution of the source, observation, and denoiser outputs from satisfying a Markov property, we give an exact characterization of the loss achieved by such a denoiser. Consequences of these results are explicitly demonstrated in special cases, including for MSE and Hamming loss. A comparison is made to an indirect rate-distortion perspective on the problem.

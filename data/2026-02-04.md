Abstract: The expanding scale of neural networks poses a major challenge for distributed machine learning, particularly under limited communication resources. While split learning (SL) alleviates client computational burden by distributing model layers between clients and server, it incurs substantial communication overhead from frequent transmission of intermediate activations and gradients. To tackle this issue, we propose NSC-SL, a bandwidth-aware adaptive compression algorithm for communication-efficient SL. NSC-SL first dynamically determines the optimal rank of low-rank approximation based on the singular value distribution for adapting real-time bandwidth constraints. Then, NSC-SL performs error-compensated tensor factorization using alternating orthogonal iteration with residual feedback, effectively minimizing truncation loss. The collaborative mechanisms enable NSC-SL to achieve high compression ratios while preserving semantic-rich information essential for convergence. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superb performance of NSC-SL.

Abstract: Telecommunications networks generate extensive performance and environmental telemetry, yet most LTE and 5G-NR deployments still rely on static, manually engineered configurations. This limits adaptability in rural, nomadic, and bandwidth-constrained environments where traffic distributions, propagation characteristics, and user behavior fluctuate rapidly. Artificial Intelligence (AI), more specifically Machine Learning (ML) models, provide new opportunities to transition Radio Access Networks (RANs) from rigid, rule-based systems toward adaptive, self-optimizing infrastructures that can respond autonomously to these dynamics. This paper proposes a practical architecture incorporating AI-assisted planning, reinforcement-learning-based RAN optimization, real-time telemetry analytics, and digital-twin-based validation. In parallel, the paper addresses the challenge of delivering embodied-AI healthcare services, educational tools, and large language model (LLM) applications to communities with insufficient backhaul for cloud computing. We introduce an edge-hosted execution model in which applications run directly on LTE/5G-NR base stations using containers, reducing latency and bandwidth consumption while improving resilience. Together, these contributions demonstrate how AI can enhance network performance, reduce operational overhead, and expand access to advanced digital services, aligning with broader goals of sustainable and inclusive network development.

Abstract: Zigbee is widely used in smart home environments due to its low power consumption and support for mesh networking, making it a relevant target for traffic-based IoT forensic analysis. However, existing studies often rely on limited datasets and fixed network configurations. In this paper, we analyze Zigbee network traffic from three complementary perspectives: data collection, traffic classification, and storage efficiency. We introduce ZIOTP2025, a publicly available dataset of Zigbee traffic collected from commercial smart home devices deployed under multiple network configurations and capturing realistic interaction scenarios. Using this dataset, we study two traffic classification tasks: device type classification and individual device identification, and evaluate their robustness under both intra-configuration and cross-configuration settings. Our results show that while high classification accuracy can be achieved under controlled conditions, performance degrades significantly when models are evaluated across different network configurations, particularly for fine-grained identification tasks. Finally, we investigate the trade-off between traffic storage requirements and classification accuracy. We show that lossy compression of traffic features through quantization can reduce storage requirements by approximately 4-5x compared to lossless storage of raw packet traces, while preserving near-lossless classification performance. Overall, our results highlight the need for topology-aware Zigbee traffic analysis and storage-efficient feature compression to enable robust and scalable IoT forensic systems.

Abstract: The rapid growth of multi-user eXtended Reality (XR) applications, spanning fields such as entertainment, education, and telemedicine, demands seamless, immersive experiences for users interacting within shared, distributed environments. Delivering such latency-sensitive experiences involves considerable challenges in orchestrating network, computing, and service resources, where existing limitations highlight the need for a structured approach to analyse and optimise these complex systems. This challenge is amplified by the need for high-performance, low-latency connectivity, where 5G and 6G networks provide essential infrastructure to meet the requirements of XR services at scale. This article addresses these challenges by developing a model that parametrises multi-user XR services across four critical layers of the standard virtualisation architecture. We formalise this model mathematically, proposing a context-aware framework that defines key parameters at each level and integrates them into a comprehensive Edge-Cloud Continuum orchestration strategy. Our contributions include a detailed analysis of the current limitations and needs in existing Edge-Cloud Continuum orchestration approaches, the formulation of a layered mathematical model, and a validation framework that demonstrates the utility and feasibility of the proposed solution.

Abstract: Stateful Middleboxes are integral part of enterprise and campus networks that provide essential in-network, security, and value-added services. These stateful middleboxes rely on precise network flow identification. However, the adoption of HTTP/3, which uses the QUIC protocol, poses significant challenges to the proper functioning of these devices. QUIC's encryption and connection migration features obscure flow semantics, disrupting middlebox visibility and functionality. We examine how QUIC disrupts middleboxes like Network Address Translators (NATs), Rate Limiters, Load Balancers, etc., and affects Kubernetes-based service deployments. To address these challenges, we propose a novel, generalized framework that enables stateful middleboxes to reliably track QUIC connections, even when the endpoints change their internet protocol (IP) address or port numbers. Our prototype implementation demonstrates that the proposed approach preserves middlebox functionality with HTTP/3 with negligible performance overhead (< 5%) on both throughput and latency, and works effectively even under high QUIC connection migration rates of up to 100 Hz.

Abstract: Video streaming is a fundamental Internet service, while the quality still cannot be guaranteed especially in poor network conditions such as bandwidth-constrained and remote areas. Existing works mainly work towards two directions: traditional pixel-codec streaming nearly approaches its limit and is hard to step further in compression; the emerging neural-enhanced or generative streaming usually fall short in latency and visual fidelity, hindering their practical deployment. Inspired by the recent success of vision foundation model (VFM), we strive to harness the powerful video understanding and processing capacities of VFM to achieve generalization, high fidelity and loss resilience for real-time video streaming with even higher compression rate. We present the first revolutionized paradigm that enables VFM-based end-to-end generative video streaming towards this goal. Specifically, Morphe employs joint training of visual tokenizers and variable-resolution spatiotemporal optimization under simulated network constraints. Additionally, a robust streaming system is constructed that leverages intelligent packet dropping to resist real-world network perturbations. Extensive evaluation demonstrates that Morphe achieves comparable visual quality while saving 62.5\% bandwidth compared to H.265, and accomplishes real-time, loss-resilient video delivery in challenging network environments, representing a milestone in VFM-enabled multimedia streaming solutions.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: In Multi-access Edge Computing networks, services can be deployed on nearby edge clouds (EC) as service function chains (SFCs) to meet strict quality of service (QoS) requirements. As users move, frequent SFC reconfigurations are required, but these are non-trivial: SFCs can serve users only when all required virtual network functions (VNFs) are available, and VNFs undergo time-consuming lifecycle operations before becoming operational. We show that ignoring lifecycle dynamics oversimplifies deployment, jeopardizes QoS, and must be avoided in practical SFC management. To address this, forecasts of user connectivity can be leveraged to proactively deploy VNFs and reconfigure SFCs. But forecasts are inherently imperfect, requiring lifecycle and connectivity uncertainty to be jointly considered. We present RIPPLE, a lifecycle-aware SFC embedding approach to deploy VNFs at the right time and location, reducing service interruptions. We show that RIPPLE closes the gap with solutions that unrealistically assume instantaneous lifecycle, even under realistic lifecycle constraints.

Abstract: Efficient channel state information (CSI) compression at the user equipment plays a key role in enabling accurate channel reconstruction and precoder design in massive multiple-input multiple-output systems. A key challenge lies in balancing the CSI feedback overhead with the achievable downlink rate, i.e., maximizing the utility of limited feedback to maintain high system performance. In this work, we propose a precoding-oriented CSI feedback framework based on a vector quantized variational autoencoder, augmented with an information-theoretic regularization. To achieve this, we introduce a differentiable mutual information lower-bound estimator as a training regularizer to promote effective utilization of the learned codebook under a fixed feedback budget. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves rates comparable to variable-length neural compression schemes, while operating with fixed-length feedback. Furthermore, the learned codewords exhibit significantly more uniform usage and capture interpretable structures that are strongly correlated with the underlying channel state information.

Abstract: The use of remote vision sensors for autonomous decision-making poses the challenge of transmitting high-volume visual data over resource-constrained channels in real-time. In robotics and control applications, many systems can quickly destabilize, which can exacerbate the issue by necessitating higher sampling frequencies. This work proposes a novel sensing paradigm in which an event camera observes the optically generated cosine transform of a visual scene, enabling high-speed, computation-free video compression inspired by modern video codecs. In this study, we simulate this optically passive vision compression (OPVC) scheme and compare its rate-distortion performance to that of a standalone event camera (SAEC). We find that the rate-distortion performance of the OPVC scheme surpasses that of the SAEC and that this performance gap increases as the spatial resolution of the event camera increases.

Abstract: Coded polynomial aggregation (CPA) in distributed computing systems enables the master to directly recover a weighted aggregation of polynomial computations without individually decoding each term, thereby reducing the number of required worker responses. However, existing CPA schemes are restricted to an idealized setting in which the system cannot tolerate stragglers. In this paper, we extend CPA to straggler-aware distributed computing systems with a pre-specified non-straggler pattern, where exact recovery is required for a given collection of admissible non-straggler sets. Our main results show that exact recovery of the desired aggregation is achievable with fewer worker responses than that required by polynomial codes based on individual decoding, and that feasibility is characterized by the intersection structure of the non-straggler patterns. In particular, we establish necessary and sufficient conditions for exact recovery in straggler-aware CPA. We identify an intersection-size threshold that is sufficient to guarantee exact recovery. When the number of admissible non-straggler sets is sufficiently large, we further show that this threshold is necessary in a generic sense. We also provide an explicit construction of feasible CPA schemes whenever the intersection size exceeds the derived threshold. Finally, simulations verify our theoretical results by demonstrating a sharp feasibility transition at the predicted intersection threshold.

Abstract: Characterization of entropy functions is of fundamental importance in information theory. By imposing constraints on their Shannon outer bound, i.e., the polymatroidal region, one obtains the faces of the region and entropy functions on them with special structures. In this paper, we characterize entropy functions on 2-dimensional faces of polymatroid region of degree n with one extreme ray containing rank-1 matroid. We classify all such 2-dimensional faces with another extreme ray containing a matroid into four types.

Abstract: Costas arrays are a special type of permutation matrices with ideal autocorrelation and low cross-correlation properties, making them valuable for radar, wireless communication, and integrated sensing and communication applications. This paper presents a novel unified framework for analyzing and discovering new Costas arrays. We introduce Universal Costas Matrices (UCMs) and Universal Costas Frequency Matrices (UCFMs) and investigate their structural characteristics. A framework integrating UCMs and UCFMs is proposed to pave the way for future artificial intelligence-assisted Costas array discovery. Leveraging the structural properties of UCMs and UCFMs, a reconstruction-based search method is developed to generate UCMs from UCFMs. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly accelerates the search process and enhances structural insight into Costas array generation.

Abstract: This work investigates the fundamental limits of implementing network oblivious transfer via noisy multiple access channels and broadcast channels between honest-but-curious parties when the parties have access to general tripartite non-signaling correlations. By modeling the shared resource as an arbitrary tripartite non-signaling box, we obtain a unified perspective on both the channel behavior and the resulting correlations. Our main result demonstrates that perfect oblivious transfer is impossible. In the asymptotic regime, we further show that even negligible leakage cannot be achieved, as repeated use of the resource amplifies the receiver(s)'s ability to distinguish messages that were not intended for him/them. In contrast, the receiver(s)'s own privacy is not subject to a universal impossibility limitation.

Abstract: This paper addresses optimal decoding strategies in lossy compression where the assumed distribution for compressor design mismatches the actual (true) distribution of the source. This problem has immediate relevance in standardized communication systems where the decoder acquires side information or priors about the true distribution that are unavailable to the fixed encoder. We formally define the mismatched quantization problem, demonstrating that the optimal reconstruction rule, termed generative decompression, aligns with classical Bayesian estimation by taking the conditional expectation under the true distribution given the quantization indices and adapting it to fixed-encoder constraints. This strategy effectively performs a generative Bayesian correction on the decoder side, strictly outperforming the conventional centroid rule. We extend this framework to transmission over noisy channels, deriving a robust soft-decoding rule that quantifies the inefficiency of standard modular source--channel separation architectures under mismatch. Furthermore, we generalize the approach to task-oriented decoding, showing that the optimal strategy shifts from conditional mean estimation to maximum a posteriori (MAP) detection. Experimental results on Gaussian sources and deep-learning-based semantic classification demonstrate that generative decompression closes a vast majority of the performance gap to the ideal joint-optimization benchmark, enabling adaptive, high-fidelity reconstruction without modifying the encoder.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Decentralized Pliable Index Coding (DPIC) problem addresses efficient information exchange in distributed systems where clients communicate among themselves without a central server. An important consideration in DPIC is the heterogeneity of side-information and demand sizes. Although many prior works assume homogeneous settings with identical side-information cardinality and single message demands, these assumptions limit real-world applicability where clients typically possess unequal amounts of prior information. In this paper, we study DPIC problem under heterogeneous side-information cardinalities. We propose a transmission scheme that coordinates client broadcasts to maximize coding efficiency while ensuring that each client achieves a common target level $T$. In addition, we impose a strict security constraint that no client acquires more than the target $T$ number of messages, guaranteeing that each client ends up with exactly $T$ messages. We analyze the communication cost incurred by the proposed scheme under this security constraint.

Abstract: The rapid growth of Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices demands communication systems that are both spectrally efficient and energy frugal. Backscatter communication (BackCom) is an attractive low-power paradigm, but its spectral efficiency declines in dense deployments. This paper presents an uplink BackCom design that integrates non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) and maximizes system energy efficiency (EE). In a bistatic network where multiple backscatter nodes (BNs) harvest RF energy and alternate between sleep and active modes, we formulate a fractional program with coupled time, power, and reflection variables and develop a Dinkelbach-based alternating optimization (AO) algorithm with closed-form updates. Analysis reveals two operating modes depending on power availability, circuit demands and propagation conditions. Simulations show the proposed design adapts the time allocation, achieving up to 8% higher EE than fixed-power and 68% than no-sleep baselines, and delivering up to 127% EE gains over orthogonal multiple access (OMA). These results establish NOMA-enabled BackCom as a scalable, energy efficient solution for large-scale IoT deployments.

Abstract: Conventional direction-of-arrival (DoA) estimation methods rely on multi-antenna arrays, which are costly to implement on size-constrained Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) devices. Virtual antenna array (VAA) techniques enable DoA estimation with a single antenna, making angle estimation feasible on such devices. However, BLE only provides a single-shot two-way channel frequency response (CFR) with a binary phase ambiguity issue, which hinders the direct application of VAA. To address this challenge, we propose a unified model that combines VAA with BLE two-way CFR, and introduce a neural network based phase recovery framework that employs row / column predictors with a voting mechanism to resolve the ambiguity. The recovered one-way CFR then enables super resolution algorithms such as MUSIC for joint time of arrival (ToA) and DoA estimation. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior performance under non-uniform VAAs, with mean square errors approaching the Cramer Rao bound at SNR $\geq$ 5 dB.

Abstract: We identify and characterize dedicated pilot symbols and other predictable elements embedded within the Starlink Ku-band downlink waveform. Exploitation of these predictable elements enables precise opportunistic positioning, navigation, and timing using compact, low-gain receivers by maximizing the signal processing gain available for signal acquisition and time-of-arrival (TOA) estimation. We develop an acquisition and demodulation framework to decode Starlink frames and disclose the explicit sequences of the edge pilots -- bands of 4QAM symbols located at both edges of each Starlink channel that apparently repeat identically across all frames, beams, channels, and satellites. We further reveal that the great majority of QPSK-modulated symbols do not carry high-entropy user data but instead follow a regular tessellated structure superimposed on a constant reference template. We demonstrate that exploiting frame-level predictable elements yields a processing gain of approximately 48 dB, thereby enabling low-cost, compact receivers to extract precise TOA measurements even from low-SNR Starlink side beams.

Abstract: Conventional sensor architectures typically restrict angle estimation to the half-space. By enabling simultaneous transmission and reflection, simultaneously transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (STAR-RIS) can support full-space angle detection. This paper develops a fullspace angle estimation framework by leveraging a finite rate of innovation (FRI) model enabled by STAR-RIS. We distinguish two practical STAR-RIS configurations: (i) an element-wise uniform setting, where all metasurface elements share identical energy-splitting (ES) coefficients and phase differences, and (ii) a nonuniform ES setting, where the phase difference is common across elements while the ES coefficients vary element-wise to increase design flexibility. For each regime, we formulate the corresponding FRI-based signal model and derive the Ziv-Zakai bound (ZZB) for angle estimation. To recover the underlying FRI sampling structure, we develop a proximal-gradient algorithm implemented via alternating projections in matrix space and establish its convergence. Exploiting the recovered FRI structure, we construct an annihilating filter whose zeros encode user angles, enabling gridless estimation via polynomial root finding. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed methods operate reliably across both configuration regimes and achieve improved angle estimation performance with low overhead.

Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) can perform both communication and sensing tasks using the same frequency band and hardware, making it a key technology for 6G. As a low-cost implementation for large-scale antenna arrays, reconfigurable holographic surfaces (RHSs) can be integrated into ISAC systems to realize the holographic ISAC paradigm, where enlarged radiation apertures achieve significant beamforming gains. In this paper, we investigate the tri-hybrid holographic ISAC framework, where the beamformer comprises digital, analog, and RHS-based electromagnetic (EM) layers. The analog layer employs a small number of phase shifters (PSs) to provide subarray-level phase control for the amplitude-modulated RHSs. Tri-hybrid beamforming provides a pathway for low-cost large-scale holographic ISAC. However, compared to conventional ISAC systems, it is challenging to achieve joint subarray-level phase control via PSs and element-level radiation amplitude control via RHSs for holographic ISAC. To address this, we present a tri-hybrid holographic ISAC scheme that minimizes sensing waveform error while satisfying the minimum user rate requirement. A joint optimization approach for PS phases and RHS amplitude responses is designed to address inter-layer coupling and distinct feasible regions. Theoretical analyses reveal that the optimized amplitude responses cluster near boundary values, i.e., 1-bit amplitude control, to reduce hardware and algorithmic complexity. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme achieves a controllable performance trade-off between communication and sensing tasks. Measured RHS beam gain validates the enhancement of holographic beamforming through subarray-level phase shifting. Moreover, as the number of RHS elements increases, the proposed approach exceeds the performance of conventional hybrid beamforming while significantly reducing the number of PSs.

Abstract: It is increasingly common for data to possess intricate structure, necessitating new models and analytical tools. Graphs, a prominent type of structure, can encode the relationships between any two entities (nodes). However, graphs neither allow connections that are not dyadic nor permit relationships between sets of nodes. We thus turn to simplicial complexes for connecting more than two nodes as well as modeling relationships between simplices, such as edges and triangles. Our data then consist of signals lying on topological spaces, represented by simplicial complexes. Much recent work explores these topological signals, albeit primarily through deterministic formulations. We propose a probabilistic framework for random signals defined on simplicial complexes. Specifically, we generalize the classical notion of stationarity. By spectral dualities of Hodge and Dirac theory, we define stationary topological signals as the outputs of topological filters given white noise. This definition naturally extends desirable properties of stationarity that hold for both time-series and graph signals. Crucially, we properly define topological power spectral density (PSD) through a clear spectral characterization. We then discuss the advantages of topological stationarity due to spectral properties via the PSD. In addition, we empirically demonstrate the practicality of these benefits through multiple synthetic and real-world simulations.

Abstract: High-resolution radar sensors are critical for autonomous systems but pose significant challenges to traditional tracking algorithms due to the generation of multiple measurements per object and the presence of multipath effects. Existing solutions often rely on the point target assumption or treat multipath measurements as clutter, whereas current extended target trackers often lack the capability to maintain trajectory continuity in complex multipath environments. To address these limitations, this paper proposes the multipath extended target generalized labeled multi-Bernoulli (MPET-GLMB) filter. A unified Bayesian framework based on labeled random finite set theory is derived to jointly model target existence, measurement partitioning, and the association between measurements, targets, and propagation paths. This formulation enables simultaneous trajectory estimation for both targets and reflectors without requiring heuristic post-processing. To enhance computational efficiency, a joint prediction and update implementation based on Gibbs sampling is developed. Furthermore, a measurement-driven adaptive birth model is introduced to initialize tracks without prior knowledge of target positions. Experimental results from simulated scenarios and real-world automotive radar data demonstrate that the proposed filter outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving superior state estimation accuracy and robust trajectory maintenance in dynamic multipath environments.

Abstract: While information securityis a fundamental requirement for wireless communications, conventional optimization based approaches often struggle with real-time implementation, and deep models, typically discriminative in nature, may lack the ability to cope with unforeseen scenarios. To address this challenge, this paper investigates the design of legitimate beamforming and artificial noise (AN) to achieve physical layer security by exploiting the conditional diffusion model. Specifically, we reformulate the security optimization as a conditional generative process, using a diffusion model to learn the inherent distribution of near-optimal joint beamforming and AN strategies. We employ a U-Net architecture with cross-attention to integrate channel state information, as the basis for the generative process. Moreover, we fine-tune the trained model using an objective incorporating the sum secrecy rate such that the security performance is further enhanced. Finally, simulation results validate the learning process convergence and demonstrate that the proposed generative method achieves superior secrecy performance across various scenarios as compared with the baselines.

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the low-complexity distributed combining scheme design for near-field cell-free extremely large-scale multiple-input-multiple-output (CF XL-MIMO) systems. Firstly, we construct the uplink spectral efficiency (SE) performance analysis framework for CF XL-MIMO systems over centralized and distributed processing schemes. Notably, we derive the centralized minimum mean-square error (CMMSE) and local minimum mean-square error (LMMSE) combining schemes over arbitrary channel estimators. Then, focusing on the CMMSE and LMMSE combining schemes, we propose five low-complexity distributed combining schemes based on the matrix approximation methodology or the symmetric successive over relaxation (SSOR) algorithm. More specifically, we propose two matrix approximation methodology-aided combining schemes: Global Statistics \& Local Instantaneous information-based MMSE (GSLI-MMSE) and Statistics matrix Inversion-based LMMSE (SI-LMMSE). These two schemes are derived by approximating the global instantaneous information in the CMMSE combining and the local instantaneous information in the LMMSE combining with the global and local statistics information by asymptotic analysis and matrix expectation approximation, respectively. Moreover, by applying the low-complexity SSOR algorithm to iteratively solve the matrix inversion in the LMMSE combining, we derive three distributed SSOR-based LMMSE combining schemes, distinguished from the applied information and initial values.

Abstract: We study a distributed beamforming approach for cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output networks, referred to as Global Statistics \& Local Instantaneous information-based minimum mean-square error (GSLI-MMSE). The scenario with multi-antenna access points (APs) is considered over three different channel models: correlated Rician fading with fixed or random line-of-sight (LoS) phase-shifts, and correlated Rayleigh fading. With the aid of matrix inversion derivations, we can construct the conventional MMSE combining from the perspective of each AP, where global instantaneous information is involved. Then, for an arbitrary AP, we apply the statistics approximation methodology to approximate instantaneous terms related to other APs by channel statistics to construct the distributed combining scheme at each AP with local instantaneous information and global statistics. With the aid of uplink-downlink duality, we derive the respective GSLI-MMSE precoding schemes. Numerical results showcase that the proposed GSLI-MMSE scheme demonstrates performance comparable to the optimal centralized MMSE scheme, under the stable LoS conditions, e.g., with static users having Rician fading with a fixed LoS path.

Abstract: Objective: EEG-based methods can predict speech intelligibility, but their accuracy and robustness lag behind behavioral tests, which typically show test-retest differences under 1 dB. We introduce the multi-decoder method to predict speech reception thresholds (SRTs) from EEG recordings, enabling objective assessment for populations unable to perform behavioral tests; such as those with disorders of consciousness or during hearing aid fitting. Approach: The method aggregates data from hundreds of decoders, each trained on different speech features and EEG preprocessing setups to quantify neural tracking (NT) of speech signals. Using data from 39 participants (ages 18-24), we recorded 29 minutes of EEG per person while they listened to speech at six signal-to-noise ratios and a quiet story. NT values were combined into a high-dimensional feature vector per subject, and a support vector regression model was trained to predict SRTs from these vectors. Main Result: Predictions correlated significantly with behavioral SRTs (r = 0.647, p < 0.001; NRMSE = 0.19), with all differences under 1 dB. SHAP analysis showed theta/delta bands and early lags had slightly greater influence. Using pretrained subject-independent decoders reduced required EEG data collection to 15 minutes (3 minutes of story, 12 minutes across six SNR conditions) without losing accuracy.

Abstract: This paper proposes a narrowband fully-analog $N$-antenna transmitter that emulates the functionality of a narrowband fully-digital $N$-antenna transmitter. Specifically, in symbol interval $m$, the proposed fully-analog transmitter synthesizes an arbitrary complex excitation vector $\bm x[m]\in\mathbb{C}^N$ with prescribed total power $\|\bm x[m]\|_2^2=P$ from a single coherent RF tone, using only tunable phase-control elements embedded in a passive interferometric programmable network. The programmable network is excited through one input port while the remaining $N - 1$ input ports are impedance matched. In the ideal lossless case, the network transfer is unitary and therefore redistributes RF power among antenna ports without dissipative amplitude control.
  The synthesis task is posed as a unitary state-preparation problem: program a unitary family so that $\bm V(\bm\varphi)\bm e_1=\bm c$, where $\bm c=\bm x/\sqrt{P}$ and $\|\bm c\|_2=1$. We provide a constructive realization and a closed-form programming rule: a binary magnitude-splitting tree allocates the desired per-antenna magnitudes $|c_n|$ using $N -1$ tunable split ratios, and a per-antenna output phase bank assigns the target phases using $N$ tunable phase shifts. The resulting architecture uses $2N-1$ real tunable degrees of freedom and admits a deterministic $O(N)$ programming procedure with no iterative optimization, enabling symbol-by-symbol updates when the chosen phase-control technology supports the required tuning speed.
  Using representative COTS components, we model the RF-front-end DC power of the proposed fully-analog transmitter and compare it against an equivalent COTS fully-digital array. For $N\le 16$, the comparison indicates significant RF-front-end power savings for the fully-analog architecture.
  The results in this paper are intended as a proof-of-concept for a narrowband fully-analog transmitter.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Federated learning in vehicular edge networks faces major challenges in efficient resource allocation, largely due to high vehicle mobility and the presence of imperfect channel state information. Many existing methods oversimplify these realities, often assuming fixed communication rounds or ideal channel conditions, which limits their effectiveness in real-world scenarios. To address this, we propose variable rate vehicular federated learning (VR-VFL), a novel federated learning method designed specifically for vehicular networks under imperfect channel state information. VR-VFL combines dynamic client selection with adaptive transmission rate selection, while also allowing round times to flex in response to changing wireless conditions. At its core, VR-VFL is built on a bi-objective optimization framework that strikes a balance between improving learning convergence and minimizing the time required to complete each round. By accounting for both the challenges of mobility and realistic wireless constraints, VR-VFL offers a more practical and efficient approach to federated learning in vehicular edge networks. Simulation results show that the proposed VR-VFL scheme achieves convergence approximately 40% faster than other methods in the literature.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Joint base station (BS) association and beam selection in multi-UAV aerial corridors constitutes a challenging radio resource management (RRM) problem. It is driven by high-dimensional action spaces, need for substantial overhead to acquire global channel state information (CSI), rapidly varying propagation channels, and stringent latency requirements. Conventional combinatorial optimization methods, while near-optimal, are computationally prohibitive for real-time operation in such dynamic environments. While learning-based approaches can mitigate computational complexity and CSI overhead, the need for extensive site-specific (SS) datasets for model training remains a key challenge. To address these challenges, we develop a Digital Twin (DT)-enabled two-stage optimization framework that couples physics-based beam gain modeling with DRL for scalable online decision-making. In the first stage, a channel twin (CT) is constructed using a high-fidelity ray-tracing solver with geo-spatial contexts, and network information to capture SS propagation characteristics, and dual annealing algorithm is employed to precompute optimal transmission beam directions. In the second stage, a Multi-Head Proximal Policy Optimization (MH-PPO) agent, equipped with a scalable multi-head actor-critic architecture, is trained on the DT-generated channel dataset to directly map complex channel and beam states to jointly execute UAV-BS-beam association decisions. The proposed PPO agent achieves a 44%-121% improvement over DQN and 249%-807% gain over traditional heuristic based optimization schemes in a dense UAV scenario, while reducing inference latency by several orders of magnitude. These results demonstrate that DT-driven training pipelines can deliver high-performance, low-latency RRM policies tailored to SS deployments suitable for real-time resource management in next-generation aerial corridor networks.

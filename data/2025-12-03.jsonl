The goal is to optimize both tree-based machine learning (ML) models and compact deep neural networks (DNNs) within strict edge-device constraints. This allows for a fair comparison and reveals trade-offs between model families. We apply constrained grid search for tree-based classifiers and hardware-aware neural architecture search (HW-NAS) for 1D convolutional neural networks (1D-CNNs). Evaluation on the Edge-IIoTset benchmark shows that selected models meet tight flash, RAM, and compute limits: LightGBM achieves 95.3% accuracy using 75 KB flash and 1.2 K operations, while the HW-NAS-optimized CNN reaches 97.2% with 190 KB flash and 840 K floating-point operations (FLOPs). We deploy the full pipeline on a Raspberry Pi 3 B Plus, confirming that tree-based models operate within 30 ms and that CNNs remain suitable when accuracy outweighs latency. These results highlight the practicality of hardware-constrained model design for real-time IDS at the edge."}

Two input formats are considered: a flattened byte sequence and a 2D packet-wise time series; we examine how input structure affects adversarial vulnerability when using resource-constrained models. Robustness is assessed against white-box attacks, specifically Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) and Projected Gradient Descent (PGD). On USTC-TFC2016, both HW-NAS models achieve over 99% clean-data accuracy while remaining within 65k parameters and 2M FLOPs.

Quotients by these parabolic subgroups represent orbits of flags, and their cardinalities asymptotically reveal entropies (as rates of exponential or superexponential growth). The multiplicative \"chain rules\" that involve these cardinalities induce, asymptotically, additive analogues for entropies. Many traditional formulas in information theory correspond to quotients of symmetric groups, which are a particular kind of reflection group; in this case, the cardinalities of orbits are given by multinomial coefficients and are asymptotically related to Shannon entropy. One can treat similarly quotients of the general linear groups over a finite field; in this case, the cardinalities of orbits are given by $q$-multinomials and are asymptotically related to the Tsallis 2-entropy. In this contribution, we consider other finite reflection groups as well as the symplectic group as an example of a classical group over a finite field (groups of Lie type). In both cases, the groups are classified by Dynkin diagrams into infinite series of similar groups $A_n$, $B_n$, $C_n$, $D_n$ and a finite number of exceptional ones. The $A_n$ series consists of the symmetric groups (reflection case) and general linear groups (Lie case).

Furthermore, social context plays a critical role in understanding user behavior, yet is often overlooked in mobile sensing research. To address these gaps, we introduce LogMe, a mobile sensing application that passively collects smartphone sensor data (accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer, and rotation vector) and prompts users for hourly self-reports capturing both sedentary activity and social context. Using this dual-label dataset, we propose DySTAN (Dynamic Cross-Stitch with Task Attention Network), a multi-task learning framework that jointly classifies both context dimensions from shared sensor inputs. It integrates task-specific layers with cross-task attention to model subtle distinctions effectively. DySTAN improves sedentary activity macro F1 scores by 21.8% over a single-task CNN-BiLSTM-GRU (CBG) model and by 8.2% over the strongest multi-task baseline, Sluice Network (SN).

First, using the solution concept of core, we investigate conditions under which it is beneficial for all users to cooperate, i.e., the grand coalition is stable. We provide several sets of sufficient conditions under which the core is non-empty as well as those under which the core is empty. Next, we use the concept of $\\mathbb{D}_c$-stability to identify a set of sufficient conditions under which the users in the network form a certain fixed number of coalitions such that all the users within each coalition cooperate among themselves. Our analytical results show how the values of different system parameters, e.g., data rates of different users, transmit and receive power, file size, bandwidth cost, etc., influence stability properties of coalitions, and provide a systematic approach to evaluating cooperation of users for multicast. We also study cooperation among different users using numerical computations.

To address these challenges, this paper introduces a machine learning framework designed to enhance surface quality assessment across diverse preprocessing techniques. To facilitate real-time laser processing monitoring, our solution aims to optimize the computational requirements of the machine learning model. Experimental results show that the proposed model not only outperforms the generalizability achieved by previous works across diverse preprocessing techniques but also significantly reduces the computational requirements for training.

For zero feedback under the generate-at-will traffic, we derive a closed-form lower bound of achievable AoI, which, to the best of our knowledge, reflects the impact of zero feedback for the first time, and propose a policy that achieves this bound in many cases by jointly applying rate splitting and modular arithmetic. For zero feedback under the Bernoulli traffic, we develop a drift-plus-penalty (DPP) policy with a threshold structure based on the theory of Lyapunov optimization and provide a closed-form performance guarantee. Furthermore, we extend the design of this DPP policy to support general imperfect feedback without increasing the online computational complexity. Numerical results verify our theoretical analysis and the AoI advantage of the proposed policies over state-of-the-art policies."}

To further improve the performance of forest monitoring, uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) are employed as the data processors to enhance computing capability. However, efficient forest monitoring with limited energy budget and computing resource presents a significant challenge. For this purpose, this paper formulates a multi-objective optimization framework to simultaneously consider three optimization objectives, which are minimizing the maximum computing delay, minimizing the total motion energy consumption, and minimizing the maximum computing resource, corresponding to efficient forest monitoring, energy consumption reduction, and computing resource control, respectively.

Two critical challenges remain:(1)a low signal-to-noise ratio in functional connectivity estimates, making it difficult to learn seizure-related interactions; and (2)expert labels for spatial pathological connectivity patterns are difficult to obtain, meanwhile lacking the patterns' representation to improve seizure detection. To address these issues, we propose a novel node-graph dual contrastive learning framework, Seizure-NGCLNet, to learn SEEG interictal suppression and ictal propagation patterns for detecting DRE seizures with high precision. First, an adaptive graph augmentation strategy guided by centrality metrics is developed to generate seizure-related brain networks. Second, a dual-contrastive learning approach is integrated, combining global graph-level contrast with local node-graph contrast, to encode both spatial structural and semantic epileptogenic features. Third, the pretrained embeddings are fine-tuned via a top-k localized graph attention network to perform the final classification. Extensive experiments on a large-scale public SEEG dataset from 33 DRE patients demonstrate that Seizure-NGCLNet achieves state-of-the-art performance, with an average accuracy of 95.93%, sensitivity of 96.25%, and specificity of 94.12%. Visualizations confirm that the learned embeddings clearly separate ictal from interictal states, reflecting suppression and propagation patterns that correspond to the clinical mechanisms.

However, in multi-user OTFS systems, conventional embedded pilot schemes require independent pilot allocation for each user, leading to linearly increasing pilot overhead. To address these issues, in this paper, we investigate the uplink channel estimation and pilot design for multi-user multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)-OTFS systems. We propose a multi-dimensional decomposition-based channel estimation algorithm. Specifically, the proposed algorithm first estimates the angles of arrivals (AoAs) via subspace decomposition-based method. A spatial projection matrix, constructed from the estimated AOAs, decouples the received signal by propagation path subspace, effectively mitigating inter-path interference. The remaining fractional delay and Doppler can be obtained by a compressed sensing (CS)-based off-grid channel estimation method. Furthermore, to reduce the pilot overhead in multi-user OTFS systems, this paper proposes a novel cyclic shift embedded pilot (CSEP) structure, which can reuse users through cyclic shift-orthogonality of Zadoff-Chu (ZC) sequences. Compared with conventional embedded pilot structures, the CSEP structure can save over 30\\% of pilot overhead. Finally, an imporved channel estimation method based on the CSEP structure is proposed. Simulation results demonstrate that it achieves superior performance in channel estimation. Moreover, the proposed CSEP structure and channel estimation algorithm achieve a favorable balance between computational complexity, estimation accuracy, and bit error rate (BER) performance."}

Specifically, we model the transmission link as shadowed-Rician fading and introduce the persistent satellite channel, wherein the channel process is governed by an i.i.d. renewal process under mild assumptions of uncoordinated handover decisions and knowledge of satellite ephemeris and fading parameters. Within this framework, we derive the ergodic capacity (persistent capacity) of the persistent satellite channel using renewal theory and establish its relation to the non-persistent capacity studied in prior work. To address computational challenges, we present closed-form upper and lower bounds on persistent capacity. The optimal handover problem is formulated as a non-linear fractional program, obtaining an explicit decision rule via a variant of Dinkelbach's algorithm. We further demonstrate that a simpler handover strategy maximising serving capacity closely approximates the optimal strategy, providing practical insights for designing high-throughput LEO satellite communication systems."}

Compared with monostatic sensing, multi-access point (AP) collaborative sensing endows mobile networks with broader, more accurate, and resilient sensing capabilities, which are critical for diverse location-based sectors. This paper focuses on collaborative sensing in multi-AP networks and proposes a Bayesian probability fusion framework for target parameter estimation using orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing waveform. The framework models multi-AP received signals as probability distributions to capture stochastic observations from channel noise and scattering coefficients. Prior information is then incorporated into the joint probability density function to cast the problem as a constrained maximum a posteriori estimation. To address the high-dimensional optimization, we develop a prior-constrained gradient ascent (PCGA) algorithm that decouples correlated parameters and performs efficient gradient updates guided by the target prior. Theoretical analysis covers optimal fusion weights for global signal-to-noise ratio maximization, PCGA convergence, and the Cramer-Rao lower bound of the estimator, with insights applicable to broader fusion schemes. Extensive numerical simulations and real-world experiments with commercial devices show the framework reduces transmission overhead by 90% versus signal fusion and lowers estimation error by 41% relative to parameter fusion. Notably, field tests achieve submeter accuracy with 50% probability in typical coverage of mmWave APs. These improvements highlight a favorable balance between communication efficiency and estimation accuracy for practical multi-AP sensing deployment.\n  The dataset is released for research purposes and is publicly available at: http://pmldatanet.com.cn/dataapp/multimodal"}

An alternating-optimization (AO) framework addresses the sparsity-constrained non-convex design by splitting it into a continuous BF/AN joint-design subproblem and a discrete FAS port-selection subproblem. Closed-form fully digital BF/AN solutions are obtained via a generalized spectral water-filling procedure within a block coordinate descent (BCD) surrogate and realized by a hardware-efficient hybrid beamforming (HBF) architecture that embeds AN in the baseband without extra radio-frequency (RF) chains. For FAS port selection, a row-energy based prune--refit rule, aligned with Karush--Kuhn--Tucker (KKT) conditions of a group-sparsity surrogate, enables efficient active-port determination.

This paper examines how these inequalities manifest in northern Finland and Sweden, where sparse populations, long distances, and seasonal variations in demand create persistent gaps in service quality and reliability. Drawing on survey data (n = 148), in-depth interviews, and spatial analysis, the study explores the lived experience of connectivity in Arctic rural communities and introduces a novel Cellular Coverage Inequality (CCI) Index. The index combines measures of rurality and network performance to quantify spatial disparities that are masked by national coverage statistics. Results reveal that headline indicators overstate inclusiveness, while local users report chronic connectivity gaps affecting work, safety, and access to services. Building on these findings, the paper outlines policy reflections in six areas: shared infrastructure and roaming frameworks, spectrum flexibility for rural operators, performance-based Quality-of-Service monitoring, standardized and transparent reporting, temporal and seasonal capacity management, and digital-skills initiatives. Together, these recommendations highlight the need for multidimensional metrics and governance mechanisms that link technical performance, spatial equity, and user experience.

In the considered system, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) operate within a structured air corridor composed of connected cubic segments, and multiple BSs need to be selectively deployed at a set of candidate locations to ensure both sensing and communication coverage throughout the corridor. In particular, we leverage the channel knowledge map (CKM) to characterize wireless channels for candidate BS sites prior to deployment, thereby facilitating the offline planning. Under this setup, we minimize the system cost in terms of the weighted sum of the air corridor length and the number of deployed BSs, subject to the constraints on both sensing and communication performance across the corridor. To solve the formulated large-scale nonconvex integer programming problem, we develop a hierarchical coarse-to-fine grid decomposition algorithm. Simulation results demonstrate the benefit of the proposed joint design in reducing the overall deployment cost while ensuring the coverage of the low-altitude ISAC networks."}

This paper proposes an Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV)-assisted cellular network with intelligent power control to address the performance gap between CEUs and CCUs. Unlike conventional approaches that either deploy UAVs for all users or use no UAV assistance, our model uses a distance-based criterion where only users beyond a reference distance receive UAV relay assistance. Each UAV operates as an amplify-and-forward relay, enabling assisted users to receive signals from both the base station and the UAV simultaneously, thereby achieving diversity gain. To optimize transmission power allocation across base stations, we employ a Deep Q-Network (DQN) learning framework that learns power control policies without requiring accurate channel models. Simulation results show that the proposed approach achieves a peak average rate of 2.28 bps/Hz at the optimal reference distance of 400m, which represents a 3.6% improvement compared to networks without UAV assistance and 0.9% improvement compared to networks where all users receive UAV support.

The system is trained on a domain-specific dataset generated through a pipeline derived from vendor documentation, ensuring strong alignment with real-world configuration practices. Extensive evaluation shows that SLM_netconfig, when using its question-to-configuration model, achieves higher syntactic accuracy and goal accuracy than LLM-NetCFG while substantially reducing translation latency and producing concise, interpretable configurations. These results demonstrate that fine-tuned small language models, as implemented in SLM_netconfig, can deliver efficient, accurate, and privacy-preserving automated configuration generation entirely on-premise, making them a practical and scalable solution for modern autonomous network configuration."}

However, CSI acquisition in FR3 systems faces significant challenges: the increased number of antennas and wider transmission bandwidth introduces prohibitive training overhead with traditional estimation approaches, as each probing captures only incomplete spatial-frequency observation, while higher carrier frequencies lead to faster temporal channel variation. To address these challenges, we propose a novel CSI acquisition framework that integrates CSI feedback, uplink (UL) and DL channel estimation, as well as channel prediction in the FR3 TDD massive MIMO systems. Specifically, we first develop the Joint UL and DL Channel Estimation Network (JUDCEN) to fuse incomplete observations based on the SRSs and CSI-RSs. By exploiting the complementary characteristics of preliminary UL and DL estimation features, obtained through initial UL estimation and quantized-feedback-assisted DL estimation, it enables full CSI reconstruction in the spatial domain. To mitigate the performance degradation in the feedback process, we propose the Transformer-MLP CSI Feedback Network (TMCFN), employing an MLP-based module to jointly exploit angle- and delay-domain features. Building upon the reconstructed full CSI, we further develop the Mamba-based Channel Prediction Network (MCPN), which exploits selective state-space model (SSM) mechanism to capture long-range temporal dynamics in the angle-delay domain for future CSI prediction. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed framework consistently outperforms benchmarks in both CSI acquisition accuracy and transmission spectral efficiency with lower computational complexity."}

For blocklength $n=p^r$ the construction uses only $r+1$ parity checks -- \\emph{near-Hamming} overhead -- and admits an index-based decoder that runs in a single pass with constant-time location and magnitude recovery from the syndromes. Based on the prototype, we develop two extensions: Code A1, which removes specific redundant trits to achieve higher information rate and support variable-length encoding; and Code A2, which incorporates two group-sum checks together with a 3-wise XOR linear independence condition on index subsets, yielding a ternary distance-4 (SEC--TED) variant. Furthermore, we demonstrate how the framework generalizes via $n$-wise XOR linearly independent sets to construct codes with distance $d = n + 1$, notably recovering the ternary Golay code for $n = 5$ -- showing both structural generality and a serendipitous link to optimal classical codes.\n  Our contribution is not optimality but \\emph{implementational simplicity} and an \\emph{array-friendly} structure: the checks are digitwise and global sums, the mapping from syndromes to error location is explicit, and the SEC--TED upgrade is modular. We position the scheme against classical $q$-ary Hamming and SPC/product-code baselines and provide a small comparison of parity overhead, decoding work, and two-error behavior."}

To overcome these challenges, we propose a multi-modal predictive beamforming method based on a cross-attention fusion mechanism that jointly leverages visual and structured sensor data. The proposed model utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to learn multi-scale spatial feature hierarchies from visual images and a Transformer encoder to capture cross-dimensional dependencies within sensor data. Then, a cross-attention fusion module is introduced to integrate complementary information between the two modalities, generating a unified and discriminative representation for accurate beam prediction. Through experimental evaluations conducted on a real-world dataset, our method reaches 79.7% Top-1 accuracy and 99.3% Top-3 accuracy, surpassing the 3D ResNet-Transformer baseline by 4.4%-23.2% across Top-1 to Top-5 metrics.

A central technical tool is a structural lemma that materializes part of the mutual information between two random variables, implicitly capturing the effect of infinitely many non-Shannon--type inequalities. This leads to conceptually transparent proofs without explicitly invoking such infinite families. Some of our bounds recover, in a unified way, what can also be deduced from the infinite families of inequalities of Matúš (2007) and of Dougherty--Freiling--Zeger (2011), while others appear to be new."}

Our results demonstrate that simple, switch-based beamforming architectures can approach the antenna-gain of all-digital solutions at significantly lower cost and complexity."}

Over the past decade, these findings have been replicated using the Brain Age paradigm, which applies machine learning techniques to estimate brain age from neuroimaging data. This approach yields a single index, the Brain Age Gap, defined as the difference between predicted and chronological age. Nevertheless, both the progressive nature of this phenomenon and the potential role of antipsychotic medication remain unclear. To investigate its progression, we compared the Brain Age Gap between individuals experiencing a first episode of psychosis and healthy controls using ANCOVA, adjusting for age, sex, body mass index, and estimated total intracranial volume. To enhance the robustness of our findings, we employed two distinct models: a transformer-inspired model based on harmonized volumetric brain features extracted with FastSurfer, and a previously trained deep learning model. To assess the potential effect of medication, we further compared bipolar patients who received antipsychotic treatment with those who did not. Mann-Whitney U test consistently showed that medicated bipolar patients did not exhibit a significantly larger Brain Age Gap. Both models converge on the conclusion that accelerated brain aging is unlikely to be explained by antipsychotic medication alone. Longitudinal studies are therefore required to clarify the temporal dynamics of brain aging in schizophrenia."}

Eldar"], "title": "Diffusion-Prior Split Gibbs Sampling for Synthetic Aperture Radar Imaging under Incomplete Measurements", "comment": null, "summary": "Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imaging plays a critical role in all-weather, day-and-night remote sensing, yet reconstruction is often challenged by noise, undersampling, and complex scattering scenarios. Conventional methods, including matched filtering and sparsity-based compressed sensing, are limited in capturing intricate scene structures and frequently suffer from artifacts, elevated sidelobes, and loss of fine details. Recent diffusion models have demonstrated superior capability in representing high-order priors; however, existing diffusion-based SAR methods still yield degraded reconstructions due to oversimplified likelihood approximations in guided sampling. In this work, we propose a diffusion-driven split Gibbs sampling framework for SAR reconstruction, rigorously integrating measurement fidelity with learned diffusion priors. By alternately performing likelihood- and prior-driven updates via proximal sampling, this method ensures progressive convergence toward the true posterior while fully leveraging the expressive power of diffusion priors. Extensive experiments on simulated and Sentinel-1A datasets demonstrate substantial performance improvements: over 7 dB average PSNR gain in simulations, along with significant sidelobe suppression (MPLSR +2.96 dB, MISLR +11.5 dB) with respect to the best baseline result. On real-world Sentinel-1A data, the method achieves an average PSNR gain of 1.6 dB while effectively reducing artifacts and preserving scene details, including ridges, edges, and fine textures. These results underscore the potential of the adapted framework as a robust and generalizable solution for high-fidelity SAR imaging across diverse sensing scenarios."}

With a distance between RISs that satisfies the far-field requirement, this architecture positions one small RIS each in the near-field of the satellite's antenna and the user on the ground. Moreover, we develop a path loss model for the double-RIS communication link, considering the near-field and far-field effects. Further, with the help of dual-stage beamforming, the proposed system maximizes the signal power and minimizes power consumption. Simulation results show that the proposed architecture can reduce the power consumption with 40 dB in the uplink, with a small $0.25^2$ $\\text{m}^2$ RIS near the user, to communicate in energy-constrained LEO satellite communication circumstances."}

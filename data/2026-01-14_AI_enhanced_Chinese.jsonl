Current scheduling exhibits two drawbacks: a granularity mismatch between coarse, task-level decisions and fine-grained, packet-level channel dynamics, and insufficient awareness of per-task complexity. Consequently, scheduling solely at the task level leads to inefficient resource utilization. This paper proposes a novel ENergy-ACcuracy Hierarchical optimization framework for split Inference, named ENACHI, that jointly optimizes task- and packet-level scheduling to maximize accuracy under energy and delay constraints. A two-tier Lyapunov-based framework is developed for ENACHI, with a progressive transmission technique further integrated to enhance adaptivity. At the task level, an outer drift-plus-penalty loop makes online decisions for DNN partitioning and bandwidth allocation, and establishes a reference power budget to manage the long-term energy-accuracy trade-off. At the packet level, an uncertainty-aware progressive transmission mechanism is employed to adaptively manage per-sample task complexity. This is integrated with a nested inner control loop implementing a novel reference-tracking policy, which dynamically adjusts per-slot transmit power to adapt to fluctuating channel conditions. Experiments on ImageNet dataset demonstrate that ENACHI outperforms state-of-the-art benchmarks under varying deadlines and bandwidths, achieving a 43.12\\% gain in inference accuracy with a 62.13\\% reduction in energy consumption under stringent deadlines, and exhibits high scalability by maintaining stable energy consumption in congested multi-user scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We identify a dichotomy in the Stein-exponent of all these setups depending on the structure of the DMC's transition law. Under any of these three constraints, when the DMC is partially-connected (i.e., some outputs cannot be induced by certain inputs) the Stein-exponent matches the exponent identified by Han and Kobayashi and by Shalaby and Papamarcou for the scenario where communication is of zero-rate but over a noiseless link.

A large number of distinct statistics have been developed over the years, all aiming to capture different aspects of ``higher-order\" information sharing. Here, we show that three of them (the dual total correlation, S-information, and O-information) are special cases of a more general function, $\u0394^{k}$ which is parameterized by a free parameter $k$. For different values of $k$, we recover different measures: $\u0394^{0}$ is equal to the S-information, $\u0394^{1}$ is equal to the dual total correlation, and $\u0394^{2}$ is equal to the negative O-information. Generally, the $\u0394^{k}$ function is arranged into a hierarchy of increasingly high-order synergies; for a given value of $k$, if $\u0394^{k}>0$, then the system is dominated by interactions with order greater than $k$, while if $\u0394^{k}<0$, then the system is dominated by interactions with order lower than $k$. $\u0394^{k}=0$ if the system is composed entirely of synergies of order-k. Using the entropic conjugation framework, we also find that the conjugate of $\u0394^{k}$, which we term $\u0393^{k}$ is arranged into a similar hierarchy of increasingly high-order redundancies.

Traditional methods, such as ray tracing and model-based approaches, often face challenges due to high computational complexity and discrepancies between models and real-world environments. In contrast, deep learning has emerged as a promising alternative, offering accurate path loss predictions with reduced computational complexity. In our research, we introduce a ResNet-based model designed to enhance path loss prediction. We employ innovative techniques to capture key features of the environment by generating transmission (Tx) and reception (Rx) depth maps, as well as a distance map from the geographic data. Recognizing the significant attenuation caused by signal reflection and diffraction, particularly at high frequencies, we have developed a weighting map that emphasizes the areas adjacent to the direct path between Tx and Rx for path loss prediction. {Extensive simulations demonstrate that our model outperforms PPNet, RPNet, and Vision Transformer (ViT) by 1.2-3.0 dB using dataset of ITU challenge 2024 and ICASSP 2023.

However, as we show, the algorithm can be easily generalized to sample dual-containing LDPC codes over non binary finite fields as well as more general quantum stabilizer LDPC codes.\n  While several constructions already exist, all of them are somewhat algebraic as they impose some specific property (e.g., the matrix being quasi-cyclic). Instead, our algorithm is purely combinatorial as we do not require anything apart from the rows of $\\mathbf H$ being sparse enough. In this sense, we can think of our algorithm as a way to sample sparse, self-orthogonal matrices that are as random as possible.\n  Our algorithm is conceptually very simple and, as a key ingredient, uses Information Set Decoding (ISD) to sample the rows of $\\mathbf H$, one at a time.

SDP acts as a standardization layer that decouples learning tasks from hardware heterogeneity. To this end, SDP enforces deterministic physical-layer sanitization, canonical tensor construction, and standardized training and evaluation procedures, decoupling learning performance from hardware-specific artifacts. Rather than introducing task-specific models, SDP establishes a principled protocol foundation for fair evaluation across diverse sensing tasks and platforms. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SDP achieves competitive accuracy while substantially improving stability, reducing inter-seed performance variance by orders of magnitude on complex activity recognition tasks.

Both tasks are performed through a beam sweeping. In the proposed scheme, coordinated APs send sensing beams toward a grid of voxels within the volumetric surveillance region simultaneously with the 5G SSB burst.

While most existing studies assume constant flow conditions, real macro scale environments such as atmospheric winds exhibit time varying behavior. In this work, airborne particle communication under time varying advection is modeled as a linear time varying (LTV) channel, and a closed form, time dependent channel impulse response is derived using the method of moving frames. Based on this formulation, the channel is characterized through its power delay profile, leading to the definition of channel dispersion time as a physically meaningful measure of channel memory and a guideline for symbol duration selection. System level simulations under directed, time varying wind conditions show that waveform design is critical for performance, enabling multi symbol modulation using a single particle type when dispersion is sufficiently controlled.

While these datasets are vital for understanding phenomena from physical to biological and social systems, the sheer magnitude of the data makes even simple storage, transmission, and basic processing highly challenging. To enable efficient and accurate execution of these data processing tasks, we require new dimensionality reduction tools that 1) do not need expensive, time-consuming training, and 2) preserve the underlying geometry of the data that has the information required to understand the measured system. Specifically, the geometry to be preserved is that induced by the fact that in many applications, streaming high-dimensional data evolves on a low-dimensional attractor manifold. Importantly, we may not know the exact structure of this manifold a priori. To solve these challenges, we present randomized filtering (RF), which leverages a specific instantiation of randomized dimensionality reduction to provably preserve non-linear manifold structure in the embedded space while remaining data-independent and computationally efficient.

In such systems, performance is often limited by the straggler problem, where the slowest worker dominates the overall computation latency. To resolve this issue, several coded computing strategies have been proposed, primarily focusing on the simplest case: the multiplication of two matrices. These approaches successfully alleviate the straggler effect, but they do so at the expense of higher computational complexity and increased storage needs at the workers. However, in many real-world applications, computations naturally involve long chains of matrix multiplications rather than just a single two-matrix product. Extending univariate polynomial coding to this setting has been shown to amplify the costs -- both computation and storage overheads grow significantly, limiting scalability. In this work, we propose two novel multivariate polynomial coding schemes specifically designed for matrix chain multiplication in distributed environments. Our results show that while multivariate codes introduce additional computational cost at the workers, they can dramatically reduce storage overhead compared to univariate extensions. This reveals a fundamental trade-off between computation and storage efficiency, and highlights the potential of multivariate codes as a practical solution for large-scale distributed linear algebra tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

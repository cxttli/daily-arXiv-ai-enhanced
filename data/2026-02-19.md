Abstract: Nonnegative sparse signal recovery has been extensively studied due to its broad applications. Recent work has integrated rectified linear unit (ReLU) techniques to enhance existing recovery algorithms. We merge Newton-type thresholding with ReLU-based approaches to propose two algorithms: Newton-Direction-Based ReLU-Thresholding (NDRT) and its enhanced variant, Newton-Direction-Based ReLU-Thresholding Pursuit (NDRTP). Theoretical analysis iindicates that both algorithms can guarantee exact recovery of nonnegative sparse signals when the measurement matrix satisfies a certain condition.. Numerical experiments demonstrate NDRTP achieves competitive performance compared to several existing methods in both noisy and noiseless scenarios.

Abstract: Reliable, continuous neural sensing on wearable edge platforms is fundamental to long-term health monitoring; however, for electroencephalography (EEG)-based sleep monitoring, dense high-frequency processing is often computationally prohibitive under tight energy budgets. To address this bottleneck, this paper proposes NeuroSleep, an integrated event-driven sensing and inference system for energy-efficient sleep staging. NeuroSleep first converts raw EEG into complementary multi-scale bipolar event streams using Residual Adaptive Multi-Scale Delta Modulation (R-AMSDM), enabling an explicit fidelity-sparsity trade-off at the sensing front end. Furthermore, NeuroSleep adopts a hierarchical inference architecture that comprises an Event-based Adaptive Multi-scale Response (EAMR) module for local feature extraction, a Local Temporal-Attention Module (LTAM) for context aggregation, and an Epoch-Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (ELIF) module to capture long-term state persistence. Experimental results using subject-independent 5-fold cross-validation on the Sleep-EDF Expanded dataset demonstrate that NeuroSleep achieves a mean accuracy of 74.2% with only 0.932 M parameters while reducing sparsity-adjusted effective operations by approximately 53.6% relative to dense processing. Compared with the representative dense Transformer baseline, NeuroSleep improves accuracy by 7.5% with a 45.8% reduction in computational load. By bridging neuromorphic encoding with state-aware modeling, NeuroSleep provides a scalable solution for always-on sleep analysis in resource-constrained wearable scenarios.

Abstract: Additive manufacturing, particularly fused deposition modeling, is transforming modern production by enabling rapid prototyping and complex part fabrication. However, its layer-by-layer process remains vulnerable to faults such as nozzle clogging, filament runout, and layer misalignment, which compromise print quality and reliability. Traditional inspection methods are costly, time-intensive, and often limited to post-process analysis, making them unsuitable for real-time intervention. In this current study, the authors developed a novel, low-cost, and portable faultdetection system that leverages multimodal sensor fusion and artificial intelligence for real-time monitoring in FDM-based 3D printing. The system integrates acoustic, vibration, and thermal sensing into a non-intrusive architecture, capturing complementary data streams that reflect both mechanical and process-related anomalies. Acoustic and thermal sensors operate in a fully contactless manner, while the vibration sensor requires minimal attachment such that it will not interfere with printer hardware, thereby preserving portability and ease of deployment. The multimodal signals are processed into spectrograms and time-frequency features, which are classified using convolutional neural networks for intelligent fault detection. The proposed system advances Industry 4.0 objectives by offering an affordable, scalable, and practical monitoring solution that improves faultdetection accuracy, reduces waste, and supports sustainable, adaptive manufacturing.

Abstract: The reliability and quality of 3D printing processes are critically dependent on the timely detection of mechanical faults. Traditional monitoring methods often rely on visual inspection and hardware sensors, which can be both costly and limited in scope. This paper explores a scalable and contactless method for the use of real-time audio signal analysis for detecting mechanical faults in 3D printers. By capturing and classifying acoustic emissions during the printing process, we aim to identify common faults such as nozzle clogging, filament breakage, pully skipping and various other mechanical faults. Utilizing Convolutional neural networks, we implement algorithms capable of real-time audio classification to detect these faults promptly. Our methodology involves conducting a series of controlled experiments to gather audio data, followed by the application of advanced machine learning models for fault detection. Additionally, we review existing literature on audio-based fault detection in manufacturing and 3D printing to contextualize our research within the broader field. Preliminary results demonstrate that audio signals, when analyzed with machine learning techniques, provide a reliable and cost-effective means of enhancing real-time fault detection.

Abstract: Vibration from an erroneous disturbance harms the manufactured components and lowers the output quality of an FDM printer. For moving machinery, vibration analysis and control are crucial. Additive manufacturing is the basis of 3D printing, which utilizes mechanical movement of the extruder to fabricate objects, and faults occur due to unwanted vibrations. Therefore, it is vital to examine the vibration patterns of a 3D printer. In this work, we observe these parameters of an FDM printer, exemplified by the MakerBot Method X. To analyze the system, it is necessary to understand the motion it generates and select appropriate sensors to detect those motions. The sensor measurement values can be used to determine the condition of the printer. We used an accelerometer and an acoustic sensor to measure the vibration and sound produced by the printer. The outputs from these sensors were examined individually. The findings show that vibration occurs at relatively low levels during continuous motion because it mainly appears at component transition edges. Due to abrupt acceleration and deceleration during zigzag motion, vibration reaches its peak.

Abstract: A pinching antennas (PAs)-aided integrated sensing and multicast communication framework is proposed. In this framework, the communication performance is measured by the multicast rate considering max-min fairness. Moreover, the sensing performance is quantified by the Bayesian Cramér-Rao bound (BCRB), where a Gauss-Hermite quadrature-based approach is proposed to compute the Bayesian Fisher information matrix. Based on these metrics, PA placement is optimized under three criteria: communications-centric (C-C), sensing-centric (S-C), and Pareto-optimal designs. These designs are investigated in two scenarios: the single-PA case and the multi-PA case. 1) For the single-PA case, a closed-form solution is derived for the location of the C-C transmit PA, while the S-C design yields optimal transmit and receive PA placements that are symmetric about the target location. Leveraging this geometric insight, the Pareto-optimal design is solved by enforcing this PA placement symmetry, thereby reducing the joint transmit and receive PA placement to the transmit PA optimization. 2) For the general multi-PA case, the PA placements constitute a highly non-convex optimization problem. To solve this, an element-wise alternating optimization-based method is proposed to sequentially optimize all PA placements for the S-C design, and is further incorporated into an augmented Lagrangian (AL) framework and a rate-profile formulation to solve the C-C and Pareto-optimal design problems, respectively. Numerical results show that: i) PASS substantially outperforms fixed-antenna baselines in both multicast rate and sensing accuracy; ii) the multicasting gain becomes more pronounced as the user density increases; and iii) the sensing accuracy improves with the number of deployed PAs.

Abstract: This paper investigates whether large-scale GNSS spoofing activity can be inferred from maritime Automatic Identification System (AIS) position reports. A data-processing framework, called SeaSpoofFinder, available here: seaspooffinder.github.io/ais_data, was developed to ingest and post-process global AIS streams and to detect candidate anomalies through a two-stage procedure. In Stage 1, implausible position jumps are identified using kinematic and data-quality filters; in Stage 2, events are retained only when multiple vessels exhibit spatially consistent source and target clustering, thereby reducing false positives from single-vessel artifacts. The resulting final potential spoofing events (FPSEs) reveal recurrent patterns in several regions, including the Baltic Sea, the Black Sea, Murmansk, Moscow, and the Haifa area, with affected footprints that can span large maritime areas. The analysis also highlights recurring non-spoofing artifacts (e.g., back-to-port jumps and data gaps) that can still pass heuristic filters in dense traffic regions. These results indicate that AIS-based monitoring can provide useful evidence for identifying and characterizing potential spoofing activity at scale, while emphasizing that AIS-only evidence does not provide definitive attribution.

Abstract: Hybrid received signal strength (RSS)-angle of arrival (AoA)-based positioning offers low-cost distance estimation and high-resolution angular measurements. Still, it comes at a cost of inherent nonlinearities, geometry-dependent noise, and suboptimal weighting in conventional linear estimators that might limit accuracy. In this paper, we propose a neural network-based approach using a multilayer perceptron (MLP) to directly map RSS-AoA measurements to 3D positions, capturing nonlinear relationships that are difficult to model with traditional methods. We evaluate the impact of input representation by comparing networks trained on raw measurements versus preprocessed features derived from a linearization method. Simulation results show that the learning-based approach consistently outperforms existing linear methods under RSS noise across all noise levels, and matches or surpasses state-of-the-art performance under increasing AoA noise. Furthermore, preprocessing measurements using the linearization method provides a clear advantage over raw data, demonstrating the benefit of geometry-aware feature extraction.

Abstract: This paper investigates the design of integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems assisted by simultaneously transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (STAR-RISs), which act as multi-functional programmable metasurfaces capable of supporting concurrent communication and sensing within a unified architecture. We propose a two-stage ISAC protocol, in which the preparation phase performs direction estimation for outdoor users located in the reflection space, while maintaining communication with both outdoor and indoor users in the transmission space. The subsequent communication phase exploits the estimated directions to enhance information transfer. The directions of outdoor users are modeled as Gaussian random variables to capture estimation uncertainty, and the corresponding average communication performance is incorporated into the design. Building on this framework, we formulate a performance-balanced optimization problem that maximizes the communication sum-rate while guaranteeing the required sensing accuracy, jointly determining the beamforming vectors at the base station (BS), the STAR-RIS transmission and reflection coefficients, and the metasurface partition between energy-splitting and transmit-only modes. The physical constraints of STAR-RIS elements and the required sensing performance are explicitly enforced. To address the non-convex nature of the problem, we combine fractional programming, Lagrangian dual reformulation, and successive convex approximation. The binary metasurface partition is ultimately recovered via continuous relaxation followed by projection-based binarization. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed design achieves an effective trade-off between sensing accuracy and communication throughput, by significantly outperforming conventional STAR-RIS-aided ISAC schemes.

Abstract: Modulo sampling is a promising technology to preserve amplitude information that exceeds the observable range of analog-to-digital converters during the digitization of analog signals. Since conventional methods typically reconstruct the original signal by estimating the differences of the residual signal and computing their cumulative sum, each estimation error inevitably propagates through subsequent time samples. In this paper, to eliminate this error-propagation problem, we propose an algorithm that reconstructs the residual signal directly. The proposed method takes advantage of the high-frequency characteristics of the modulo samples and the sparsity of both the residual signal and its difference. Simulation results show that the proposed method reconstructs the original signal more accurately than a conventional method based on the differences of the residual signal.

Abstract: Channel measurements in MIMO systems hinge on precise synchronization. While methods for time and frequency synchronization are well established, maintaining real-time phase coherence remains an open requirement for many MIMO systems. Phase coherence in MIMO systems is crucial for beamforming in digital arrays and enables precise parameter estimates such as Angle-of-Arrival/Departure. This work presents and validates a simple local real-time phase calibration method for a digital array. We compare two different approaches, instantaneous and smoothed calibration, to determine the optimal interval between synchronization procedures. To quantitatively assess calibration performance, we use two metrics: the average beamforming power loss and the RMS cycle-to-cycle jitter. Our results indicate that both approaches for phase calibration are effective and yield RMS of jitter in the 2.1 ps to 124 fs range for different SDR models. This level of precision enables coherent transmission on commonly available SDR platforms, allowing investigation on advanced MIMO techniques and transmit beamforming in practical testbeds.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: This paper presents a Failure-Aware Access Point Selection (FAAS) method aimed at improving hardware resilience in cell-free massive MIMO (CF-mMIMO) networks. FAAS selects APs for each user by jointly considering channel strength and the failure probability of each AP. A tunable parameter \(α\in [0,1]\) scales these failure probabilities to model different levels of network stress. We evaluate resilience using two key metrics: the minimum-user spectral efficiency, which captures worst-case user performance, and the outage probability, defined as the fraction of users left without any active APs. Simulation results show that FAAS maintains significantly better performance under failure conditions compared to failure-agnostic clustering. At high failure levels, FAAS reduces outage by over 85\% and improves worst-case user rates. These results confirm that FAAS is a practical and efficient solution for building more reliable CF-mMIMO networks.

Abstract: Experimentalists often use wind tunnels to study aerodynamic turbulence, but most wind tunnel imaging techniques are limited in their ability to take non-invasive 3D density measurements of turbulence. Wavefront tomography is a technique that uses multiple wavefront measurements from various viewing angles to non-invasively measure the 3D density field of a turbulent medium. Existing methods make strong assumptions, such as a spline basis representation, to address the ill-conditioned nature of this problem. We formulate this problem as a Bayesian, sparse-view tomographic reconstruction problem and develop a model-based iterative reconstruction algorithm for measuring the volumetric 3D density field inside a wind tunnel. We call this method WindDensity-MBIR and apply it using simulated data to difficult reconstruction scenarios with sparse data, small projection field of view, and limited angular extent. WindDensity-MBIR can recover high-order features in these scenarios within 10% to 25% error even when the tip, tilt, and piston are removed from the wavefront measurements.

Abstract: We present the RIS-VSign system, an active reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted multiple-input multiple-output orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (MIMO-OFDM) framework for vital signs extraction under an integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) model. The system consists of two stages: the phase selector of RIS and the extraction of respiration rate. To mitigate synchronization-induced common phase drifts, the difference of Möbius transformation (DMT) is integrated into the deep learning framework, named DMTNet, to jointly configure multiple active RIS elements. Notably, the training data are generated in simulation without collecting real-world measurements, and the resulting phase selector is validated experimentally. For sensing, multi-antenna measurements are fused by the DC-offset calibration and the DeepMining-MMV processing with CA-CFAR detection and Newton's refinements. Prototype experiments indicate that active RIS deployment improves respiration detectability while simultaneously enabling higher-order modulation; without RIS, respiration detection is unreliable and only lower-order modulation is supported.

Abstract: Open Web 3.0 platforms increasingly operate as \emph{service ecosystems} (e.g., DeFi, DAOs, and decentralized social applications) where \emph{admission control} and \emph{account provisioning} must be delivered as an always-on service under bursty demand. Service operators face a fundamental tension: enforcing Sybil resistance (one-person-one-account) while preserving user privacy, yet keeping on-chain verification cost and admission latency predictable at scale. Existing credential-based ZK admission approaches typically require per-request on-chain verification, making the provisioning cost grow with the number of concurrent joiners. We present \textbf{ZK-AMS}, a scalable admission and provisioning layer that bridges real-world \emph{Personhood Credentials} to anonymous on-chain service accounts. ZK-AMS combines (i) zero-knowledge credential validation, (ii) a \emph{permissionless} batch submitter model, and (iii) a decentralized, privacy-preserving folding pipeline that uses Nova-style recursive aggregation together with multi-key homomorphic encryption, enabling batch settlement with \emph{constant} on-chain verification per batch. We implement ZK-AMS end-to-end on an Ethereum testbed and evaluate admission throughput, end-to-end latency, and gas consumption. Results show stable verification cost across batch sizes and substantially improved admission efficiency over non-recursive baselines, providing a practical and cost-predictable admission service for large-scale Web 3.0 communities.

Abstract: In this work, we present an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) wireless dataset collected as part of the AERPAW Autonomous Aerial Data Mule (AADM) challenge, organized by the NSF Aerial Experimentation and Research Platform for Advanced Wireless (AERPAW) project. The AADM challenge was the second competition in which an autonomous UAV acted as a data mule, where the UAV downloaded data from multiple base stations (BSs) in a dynamic wireless environment. Participating teams designed flight control and decision-making algorithms for choosing which BSs to communicate with and how to plan flight trajectories to maximize data download within a mission completion time. The competition was conducted in two stages: Stage 1 involved development and experimentation using a digital twin (DT) environment, and in Stage 2, the final test run was conducted on the outdoor testbed. The total score for each team was compiled from both stages. The resulting dataset includes link quality and data download measurements, both in DT and physical environments. Along with the USRP measurements used in the contest, the dataset also includes UAV telemetry, Keysight RF sensors position estimates, link quality measurements from LoRa receivers, and Fortem radar measurements. It supports reproducible research on autonomous UAV networking, multi-cell association and scheduling, air-to-ground propagation modeling, DT-to-real-world transfer learning, and integrated sensing and communication, which serves as a benchmark for future autonomous wireless experimentation.

Abstract: Mobile edge computing (MEC) based wireless metaverse services offer an untethered, immersive experience to users, where the superior quality of experience (QoE) needs to be achieved under stringent latency constraints and visual quality demands. To achieve this, MEC-based intelligent resource allocation for virtual reality users needs to be supported by coordination across MEC servers to harness distributed data. Federated learning (FL) is a promising solution, and can be combined with reinforcement learning (RL) to develop generalized policies across MEC-servers. However, conventional FL incurs transmitting the full model parameters across the MEC-servers and the cloud, and suffer performance degradation due to naive global aggregation, especially in heterogeneous multi-radio access technology environments. To address these challenges, this paper proposes Federated Split Decision Transformer (FSDT), an offline RL framework where the transformer model is partitioned between MEC servers and the cloud. Agent-specific components (e.g., MEC-based embedding and prediction layers) enable local adaptability, while shared global layers in the cloud facilitate cooperative training across MEC servers. Experimental results demonstrate that FSDT enhances QoE for up to 10% in heterogeneous environments compared to baselines, while offloadingnearly 98% of the transformer model parameters to the cloud, thereby reducing the computational burden on MEC servers.

Abstract: Future vehicular networks require continuous connectivity to serve highly mobile users in urban environments. To mitigate the coverage limitations of fixed terrestrial macro base stations (MBS) under non line-of-sight (NLoS) conditions, fleets of unmanned aerial base stations (UABSs) can be deployed as aerial base stations, dynamically repositioning to track vehicular users and traffic hotspots in coordination with the terrestrial network. This paper addresses cooperative multi-agent trajectory design under different service areas and takeoff configurations, where rapid and safe adaptation across scenarios is essential. We formulate the problem as a multi-task decentralized partially observable Markov decision process and solve it using centralized training and decentralized execution with double dueling deep Q-network (3DQN), enabling online training for real-world deployments. However, efficient exploration remains a bottleneck, with conventional strategies like $ε$-greedy requiring careful tuning. To overcome this, we propose the multi-agent meta-advisor with advisor override (MAMO). This framework guides agent exploration through a meta-policy learned jointly across tasks. It uses a dynamic override mechanism that allows agents to reject misaligned guidance when the advisor fails to generalize to a specific scenario. Simulation results across three realistic urban scenarios and multiple takeoff configurations show that MAMO achieves faster convergence and higher returns than tuned $ε$-greedy baselines, outperforming both an advisor-only ablation and a single generalized policy. Finally, we demonstrate that the learned UABS fleet significantly improves network performance compared to deployments without aerial support.

Performance evaluation under a worst-case scenario with 20 nodes, asymmetric channel sets of size 20, channel similarity index (m) as 2, and high primary radio activity shows that M-DMCA achieves a 24% reduction in rendezvous time compared to the multihop Extended Modular Clock Algorithm (EMCA), outperforming existing rendezvous protocols.

Abstract: The next generation of mobile networks, 6G, is expected to enable data-driven services at unprecedented scale and complexity, with stringent requirements for trust, interoperability, and automation. Central to this vision is the ability to create, manage, and share high-quality datasets across distributed and heterogeneous environments. This paper presents the data architecture of the 6G-DALI project, which implements a federated dataspace and DataOps infrastructure to support secure, compliant, and scalable data sharing for AI-driven experimentation and service orchestration. Drawing from principles defined by GAIA-X and the International Data Spaces Association (IDSA), the architecture incorporates components such as federated identity management, policy-based data contracts, and automated data pipelines. We detail how the 6G-DALI architecture aligns with and extends GAIA-X and IDSA reference models to meet the unique demands of 6G networks, including low-latency edge processing, dynamic trust management, and cross-domain federation. A comparative analysis highlights both convergence points and necessary innovations.

Abstract: A network is represented as a graph consisting of nodes and edges. A cut set for a source-destination pair in a network is a set of elements that, when failed, cause the source-destination pair to lose connectivity. A Minimal Cut Set (MCS) is a cut set that cannot be further reduced while maintaining its status as a cut set. MCSs are crucial in identifying the critical elements in the network that have the most significant impact on failure. This work introduces Fast-MCS, an open-source, scalable tool for evaluating MCSs in large, complex networks. Additionally, we compare the computation time of Fast-MCS with the state-of-the-art.

Abstract: This article defines multi-twisted Goppa (MTG) codes as subfield subcodes of duals of multi-twisted Reed-Solomon (MTRS) codes and examines their properties. We show that if $t$ is the degree of the MTG polynomial defining an MTG code, its minimum distance is at least $t + 1$ under certain conditions. Extending earlier methods limited to single twist at last position, we use the extended Euclidean algorithm to efficiently decode MTG codes with a single twist at any position, correcting up to $\left\lfloor \tfrac{t}{2} \right\rfloor$ errors. This decoding method highlights the practical potential of these codes within the Niederreiter public key cryptosystem (PKC). Furthermore, we establish that the Niederreiter PKC based on MTG codes is secure against partial key recovery attacks. Additionally, we also reduce the public key size by constructing quasi-cyclic MTG codes using a non-trivial automorphism group.

Abstract: This paper proposes a scalable Bayesian optimization (BO) framework for dense base-station (BS) configuration design. BO can find an optimal BS configuration by iterating parameter search, channel simulation, and probabilistic modeling of the objective function. However, its performance is severely affected by the curse of dimensionality, thereby reducing its scalability. To overcome this limitation, the proposed method sequentially optimizes per-BS parameters based on block coordinate descent while fixing the remaining BS configurations, thereby reducing the effective dimensionality of each optimization step. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly outperforms naive optimization in dense deployment scenarios.

Abstract: This paper extends the foundational work of Dollma \emph{et al}. on codes for ordered composite DNA sequences. We consider the general setting with an alphabet of size $q$ and a resolution parameter $k$, moving beyond the binary ($q=2$) case primarily studied previously. We investigate error-correcting codes for substitution errors and deletion errors under several channel models, including $(e_1,\ldots,e_k)$-composite error/deletion, $e$-composite error/deletion, and the newly introduced $t$-$(e_1,\ldots,e_t)$-composite error/deletion model.
  We first establish equivalence relations among families of composite-error correcting codes (CECCs) and among families of composite-deletion correcting codes (CDCCs). This significantly reduces the number of distinct error-parameter sets that require separate analysis. We then derive novel and general upper bounds on the sizes of CECCs using refined sphere-packing arguments and probabilistic methods. These bounds together cover all values of parameters $q$, $k$, $(e_1,\ldots,e_k)$ and $e$. In contrast, previous bounds were only established for $q=2$ and limited choices of $k$, $(e_1,\ldots,e_k)$ and $e$. For CDCCs, we generalize a known non-asymptotic upper bound for $(1,0,\ldots,0)$-CDCCs and then provide a cleaner asymptotic bound.
  On the constructive side, for any $q\ge2$, we propose $(1,0,\ldots,0)$-CDCCs, $1$-CDCCs and $t$-$(1,\ldots,1)$-CDCCs with near-optimal redundancies. These codes have efficient and systematic encoders. For substitution errors, we design the first explicit encoding and decoding algorithms for the binary $(1,0,\ldots,0)$-CECC constructed by Dollma \emph{et al}, and extend the approach to general $q$. Furthermore, we give an improved construction of binary $1$-CECCs, a construction of nonbinary $1$-CECCs, and a construction of $t$-$(1,\ldots,1)$-CECCs. These constructions are also systematic.

Abstract: Ambient backscatter communication (AmBC) enables ultra-low-power connectivity by allowing passive backscatter devices (BDs) to convey information through reflection of ambient signals. However, the cascaded AmBC channel suffers from severe double path loss and multiplicative fading, while accurate channel state information (CSI) acquisition is highly challenging due to the weak backscattered signal and the resource-limited nature of BDs. To address these challenges, this paper considers an AmBC system in which the reader is equipped with a pixel-based fluid antenna system (FAS). By dynamically selecting one antenna position from a dense set of pixels within a compact aperture, the FAS-enabled reader exploits spatial diversity through measurement-driven port selection, without requiring explicit CSI acquisition or multiple RF chains. The intrinsic rate-energy tradeoff at the BD is also incorporated by jointly optimizing the backscatter modulation coefficient under an energy harvesting (EH) neutrality constraint. To efficiently solve this problem, a particle swarm optimization (PSO)-based framework is developed to jointly determine the FAS port selection and modulation coefficient on an optimize-then-average (OTA) basis. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme significantly improves the achievable rate compared with conventional single-antenna readers, with gains preserved under imperfect observations, stringent EH constraints, and different pixel spacings.

Abstract: In this letter, we develop a continuous fluid antenna (FA) framework for uplink channel estimation in cell-free massive multiple-input and multiple-output (CF-mMIMO) systems. By modeling the wireless channel as a spatially correlated Gaussian random field, channel estimation is formulated as a Gaussian process (GP) regression problem with motion-constrained spatial sampling. Closed-form expressions for the linear minimum mean squared error (LMMSE) estimator and the corresponding estimation error are derived. A fundamental comparison with discrete port-based architectures is established under identical position constraints, showing that continuous FA sampling achieves equal or lower estimation error for any finite pilot budget, with strict improvement for non-degenerate spatial correlation models. Numerical results validate the analysis and show the performance gains of continuous FA sampling over discrete baselines.

Abstract: The Ingleton inequality is a classical linear information inequality that holds for representable matroids but fails to be universally valid for entropic vectors. Understanding the extent to which this inequality can be violated has been a longstanding problem in information theory. In this paper, we show that for a broad class
  of jointly distributed random variables $(X,Y)$ the Ingleton inequality holds up to a small additive error, even even though the mutual information between $X$ and $Y$ is far from being extractable. Contrary to common intuition, strongly non-extractable mutual information does not lead to large violations of the Ingleton inequality in this setting. More precisely, we consider pairs $(X,Y)$ that are uniformly distributed on their joint support and whose associated biregular bipartite graph is an expander. For all auxiliary random variables $A$ and $B$ jointly distributed with $(X,Y)$, we establish a lower bound on the Ingleton quantity $I(X:Y | A) + I(X:Y | B) + I(A:B) - I(X:Y)$ in terms of the spectral parameters of the underlying graph. Our proof combines the expander mixing lemma with a partitioning technique for finite sets.

Abstract: In symmetric private information retrieval (SPIR), a user communicates with multiple servers to retrieve from them a message in a database, while not revealing the message index to any individual server (user privacy), and learning no additional information about the database (database privacy). We study the problem of SPIR on graph-replicated database systems, where each node of the graph represents a server and each link represents a message. Each message is replicated at exactly two servers; those at which the link representing the message is incident. To ensure database privacy, the servers share a set of common randomness, independent of the database and the user's desired message index. We study two cases of common randomness distribution to the servers: i) graph-replicated common randomness, and ii) fully-replicated common randomness. Given a graph-replicated database system, in i), we assign one randomness variable independently to every pair of servers sharing a message, while in ii), we assign an identical set of randomness variable to all servers, irrespective of the underlying graph. In both settings, our goal is to characterize the SPIR capacity, i.e., the maximum number of desired message symbols retrieved per downloaded symbol, and quantify the minimum amount of common randomness required to achieve the capacity. To this goal, in setting i), we derive a general lower bound on the SPIR capacity, and show it to be tight for path and regular graphs through a matching converse. Moreover, we establish that the minimum size of common randomness required for SPIR is equal to the message size. In setting ii), the SPIR capacity improves over the first, more restrictive setting. We show this through capacity lower bounds for a class of graphs, by constructing SPIR schemes from PIR schemes.

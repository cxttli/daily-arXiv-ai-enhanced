Abstract: The deployment of extremely large aperture arrays (ELAAs) in sixth-generation (6G) networks could shift communication into the near-field communication (NFC) regime. In this regime, signals exhibit spherical wave propagation, unlike the planar waves in conventional far-field systems. Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) can dynamically adjust phase shifts to support NFC beamfocusing, concentrating signal energy at specific spatial coordinates. However, effective RIS utilization depends on both rapid channel state information (CSI) estimation and proactive blockage mitigation, which occur on inherently different timescales. CSI varies at millisecond intervals due to small-scale fading, while blockage events evolve over seconds, posing challenges for conventional single-level control algorithms. To address this issue, we propose a dual-transformer (DT) hierarchical framework that integrates two specialized transformer models within a hierarchical deep reinforcement learning (HDRL) architecture, referred to as the DT-HDRL framework. A fast-timescale transformer processes ray-tracing data for rapid CSI estimation, while a vision transformer (ViT) analyzes visual data to predict impending blockages. In HDRL, the high-level controller selects line-of-sight (LoS) or RIS-assisted non-line-of-sight (NLoS) transmission paths and sets goals, while the low-level controller optimizes base station (BS) beamfocusing and RIS phase shifts using instantaneous CSI. This dual-timescale coordination maximizes spectral efficiency (SE) while ensuring robust performance under dynamic conditions. Simulation results demonstrate that our approach improves SE by approximately 18% compared to single-timescale baselines, while the proposed blockage predictor achieves an F1-score of 0.92, providing a 769 ms advance warning window in dynamic scenarios.

Abstract: High altitude platform station (HAPS) systems are becoming crucial facilitators for future wireless communication networks, enhancing connectivity across all vertical communication layers, including small Internet of Things (IoT) sensors and devices, terrestrial users, and aerial devices. In the context of the widely recognized vertical heterogeneous network (VHetNet) architecture, HAPS systems can provide service to both aerial and ground users. However, integrating HAPS systems as a core element in the VHetNet architecture presents a considerable energy challenge, marking a prominent constraint for their operation. Driven by this challenge, we introduce an energy harvesting (EH) strategy tailored for HAPS systems, enabling a HAPS system to gather energy from another HAPS system, which is not constrained by energy limitations. To assess the performance capabilities of the proposed model, we derive outage probability (OP), ergodic capacity (EC) and verify them by using Monte Carlo (MC) simulations. Moreover, we explore the system in terms of throughput. The findings reveal that harnessing full potential of EH stands as a viable approach to meet the energy demands of HAPS systems.

Abstract: Cross-Phase Modulation (XPM) constitutes a critical nonlinear impairment in high-capacity Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM) systems, significantly driven by intensity fluctuations (IFs) that evolve due to chromatic dispersion. This paper presents an enhanced XPM model that explicitly incorporates frequency-domain IF growth along the fiber, improving upon prior models that focused primarily on temporal pulse deformation. A direct correlation between this frequency-domain growth and XPM-induced phase distortions is established and analyzed. Results demonstrate that IF evolution, particularly at lower frequencies, profoundly affects XPM phase fluctuation spectra and phase variance. Validated through simulations, the model accurately predicts these spectral characteristics across various system parameters. Furthermore, the derived phase variance enables accurate prediction of system performance in terms of Bit Error Ratio (BER). These findings highlight the necessity of modeling frequency-domain IF evolution to accurately characterize XPM impairments, offering guidance for the design of advanced optical networks.

Abstract: A subspace code is a nonempty collection of subspaces of the vector space $\mathbb{F}_q^{n}$. A pair of linear codes is called a linear complementary pair (in short LCP) of codes if their intersection is trivial and the sum of their dimensions equals the dimension of the ambient space. Equivalently, the two codes form an LCP if the direct sum of these two codes is equal to the entire space. In this paper, we introduce the concept of LCPs of subspace codes. We first provide a characterization of subspace codes that form an LCP. Furthermore, we present a sufficient condition for the existence of an LCP of subspace codes based on a complement function on a subspace code. In addition, we give several constructions of LCPs for subspace codes using various techniques and provide an application to insertion error correction.

Abstract: This paper introduces a class of Hermitian LCD $2$-quasi-abelian codes over finite fields and presents a comprehensive enumeration of these codes in which relative minimum weights are small. We show that such codes are asymptotically good over finite fields. Furthermore, we extend our analysis to finite chain rings by characterizing $2$-quasi-abelian codes in this setting and proving the existence of asymptotically good Hermitian LCD $2$-quasi-abelian codes over finite chain rings as well.

Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) enable programmable control of the wireless propagation environment and are key enablers for future networks. Beyond-diagonal RIS (BD-RIS) architectures enhance conventional RIS by interconnecting elements through tunable impedance components, offering greater flexibility with higher circuit complexity. However, excessive interconnections between BD-RIS elements require multi-layer printed circuit board (PCB) designs, increasing fabrication difficulty. In this letter, we use graph theory to characterize the BD-RIS architectures that can be realized on double-layer PCBs, denoted as planar-connected RISs. Among the possible planar-connected RISs, we identify the ones with the most degrees of freedom, expected to achieve the best performance under practical constraints.

Abstract: Error-correcting codes are combinatorial objects designed to cope with the problem of reliable transmission of information on a noisy channel. A fundamental problem in coding theory and practice is to efficiently decode the received word with errors to obtain the transmitted codeword. In this paper, we consider the decoding problem of Hyperderivative Reed-Solomon (HRS) codes with respect to the NRT metric. Specifically, we propose a Welch-Berlekamp algorithm for the unique decoding of NRT HRS codes.

Abstract: Low-altitude wireless networks (LAWNs) are expected to play a central role in future 6G infrastructures, yet uplink transmissions of uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) remain vulnerable to eavesdropping due to their limited transmit power, constrained antenna resources, and highly exposed air-ground propagation conditions. To address this fundamental bottleneck, we propose a flexible-duplex cell-free (CF) architecture in which each distributed access point (AP) can dynamically operate either as a receive AP for UAV uplink collection or as a transmit AP that generates cooperative artificial noise (AN) for secrecy enhancement. Such AP-level duplex flexibility introduces an additional spatial degree of freedom that enables distributed and adaptive protection against wiretapping in LAWNs. Building upon this architecture, we formulate a max-min secrecy-rate problem that jointly optimizes AP mode selection, receive combining, and AN covariance design. This tightly coupled and nonconvex optimization is tackled by first deriving the optimal receive combiners in closed form, followed by developing a penalty dual decomposition (PDD) algorithm with guaranteed convergence to a stationary solution. To further reduce computational burden, we propose a low-complexity sequential scheme that determines AP modes via a heuristic metric and then updates the AN covariance matrices through closed-form iterations embedded in the PDD framework. Simulation results show that the proposed flexible-duplex architecture yields substantial secrecy-rate gains over CF systems with fixed AP roles. The joint optimization method attains the highest secrecy performance, while the low-complexity approach achieves over 90% of the optimal performance with an order-of-magnitude lower computational complexity, offering a practical solution for secure uplink communications in LAWNs.

Abstract: A $t$-all-symbol PIR code and a $t$-all-symbol batch code of dimension $k$ consist of $n$ servers storing linear combinations of $k$ linearly independent information symbols with the following recovery property: any symbol stored by a server can be recovered from $t$ pairwise disjoint subsets of servers. In the batch setting, we further require that any multiset of size $t$ of stored symbols can be recovered from $t$ disjoint subsets of servers. This framework unifies and extends several well-known code families, including one-step majority-logic decodable codes, (functional) PIR codes, and (functional) batch codes.
  In this paper, we determine the minimum code length for some small values of $k$ and $t$, characterize structural properties of codes attaining this optimum, and derive bounds that show the trade-offs between length, dimension, minimum distance, and $t$. In addition, we study MDS codes and the simplex code, demonstrating how these classical families fit within our framework, and establish new cases of an open conjecture from \cite{YAAKOBI2020} concerning the minimal $t$ for which the simplex code is a $t$-functional batch code.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Grant-free cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (GF-CF-MaMIMO) systems are anticipated to be a key enabling technology for next-generation Internet-of-Things (IoT) networks, as they support massive connectivity without explicit scheduling. However, the large amount of connected devices prevents the use of orthogonal pilot sequences, resulting in severe pilot contamination (PC) that degrades channel estimation and data detection performance. Furthermore, scalable GF-CF-MaMIMO networks inherently rely on distributed signal processing. In this work, we consider the uplink of a GF-CF-MaMIMO system and propose two novel distributed algorithms for joint activity detection, channel estimation, and data detection (JACD) based on expectation propagation (EP). The first algorithm, denoted as JACD-EP, uses Gaussian approximations for the channel variables, whereas the second, referred to as JACD-EP-BG, models them as Bernoulli-Gaussian (BG) random variables. To integrate the BG distribution into the EP framework, we derive its exponential family representation and develop the two algorithms as efficient message passing over a factor graph constructed from the a posteriori probability (APP) distribution. The proposed framework is inherently scalable with respect to both the number of access points (APs) and user equipments (UEs). Simulation results show the efficient mitigation of PC by the proposed distributed algorithms and their superior detection accuracy compared to (genie-aided) centralized linear detectors.

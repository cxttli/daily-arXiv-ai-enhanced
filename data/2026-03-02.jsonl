While effective for isolated models, these suffer from limited generalization, fragmented decision-making across network domains, and significant maintenance overhead due to frequent retraining. To address these limitations, we propose a novel AI agent-based RAN-CN converged intelligence framework that leverages a Large Language Model (LLM) integrated with the Reasoning and Acting (ReAct) paradigm. The proposed framework enables the AI agent to iteratively reason over real-time, cross-domain state information stored in a centralized monitoring database and to synthesize adaptive control policies through a closed-loop thought-action-observation process. Unlike conventional Machine Learning (ML) based approaches, it does not rely on model retraining. Instead, the AI agent dynamically queries and interprets structured network data to generate context-aware control decisions, allowing for fast and flexible adaptation to changing network conditions. Experimental results demonstrate the enhanced generalization capability and superior adaptability of the proposed framework to previously unseen network scenarios, highlighting its potential as a unified control intelligence for next-generation networks."}

However, in LAINs, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are characterized by the distributed topology and high mobility, thus vulnerable to security threats, which may degrade routing performances for data transmissions. Hence, how to ensure the routing stability and security of LAINs is challenging. In this paper, we focus on the routing with multiple UAV clusters in LAINs. To minimize the damage caused by potential threats, we present the zero-trust architecture with the software-defined perimeter and blockchain techniques to manage the identify and mobility of UAVs. Besides, we formulate the routing problem to optimize the end-to-end (E2E) delay and transmission success ratio (TSR) simultaneously, which is an integer nonlinear programming problem and intractable to solve. Therefore, we reformulate the problem into a decentralized partially observable Markov decision process. We design the multi-agent double deep Q-network-based routing algorithms to solve the problem, empowered by the soft-hierarchical experience replay buffer and prioritized experience replay mechanisms. Finally, extensive simulations are conducted and the numerical results demonstrate that the proposed framework reduces the average E2E delay by 59\\% and improves the TSR by 29\\% on average compared to benchmarks, while simultaneously enabling faster and more robust identification of low-trust UAVs."}

In this paper, we solve this open problem for no-wait schedules on the daisy-chain topology, one of the most commonly used topologies. Precisely, we develop an efficient algorithm that optimally computes no-wait schedules for the daisy-chain topology, with a time complexity that scales polynomially in both the number of streams and the network size.\n  The basic idea is to recast the no-wait scheduling problem as a variant of a graph coloring problem where some restrictions are imposed on the colors available for every vertex, and where the underlying graph is an interval graph. Our main technical part is to show that this variant of graph coloring problem can be solved in polynomial time for interval graphs, though it is NP-hard for general graphs. Evaluations based on real-life TSN systems demonstrate its optimality and its ability to scale with up to tens of thousands of streams."}

The introduction of frequency range 3 (FR3, 7-24 GHz), comprising non-contiguous sub-bands across a wide frequency span, further reinforces the importance of multi-band operation. In such scenarios, frequency-dependent propagation effects that are collectively referred to as dense multipath components (DMC), including clutter, diffraction, and diffuse scattering, must be carefully considered. Building on prior literature and our experimental observations, this paper proposes a novel ISAC channel analysis tailored to multi-band sensing, based on a channel model with background DMCs. It also assesses the sensing trade-offs among sub-bands by analyzing Cramér-Rao bound (CRB)-based fundamental limits. Furthermore, a scalable multi-band estimator is proposed that resolves angular ambiguities arising from the grating lobes effect. Simulation results of the multi-band estimator demonstrate substantial gains in estimation accuracy and reductions in false alarm rate over single-band estimators operating on each constituent sub-band within the CRB-achieving regime. In a representative test case, the proposed estimator achieves reductions of 37.41% and 17.04% in the root mean squared error of delay estimation compared to single-band estimators operating at 8.75 GHz and 21.7 GHz, respectively."}

We consider an S-IoT system consisting of a sender-receiver pair connected by a data channel and a feedback channel and capture its dynamics using a Markov Decision Process (MDP). To extend battery life, the sender has to decide on deep-sleep durations. Deep-sleep scheduling is the primary lever to reduce energy consumption, since sleeping devices consume only a fraction of their idle power. By choosing its deep-sleep duration online, the sender has to find a trade-off between energy consumption and data quality degradation at the receiver, captured by a weighted sum of costs. We quantify data quality degradation via the recently introduced Goal-Oriented Tensor (GoT) metric, which can take both age and content of delivered data into account. We assume a Markovian observed process and Markov channels with time-varying delay and erasure rates. The challenge is that content awareness of the GoT metric makes periodic transmissions inherently inefficient. Additionally, optimal sleep durations depends on the (unknown) future states of the observed process and the channels, both of which must be inferred online. We propose a novel algorithm using probabilistic simulation-based optimization (PSBO). With PSBO, the sensor forecasts future states based on estimated transition probabilities, and uses these forecasts to select the optimal deep-sleep duration. Extensive simulations and experiments with S-IoT hardware demonstrate superior performance of PSBO under diverse conditions."}

To address these limitations, we propose a discrete representation of sEMG signals based on a physiology-informed tokenization framework. The method employs a sliding window aligned with the minimal muscle contraction cycle to isolate individual muscle activation events. From each window, ten time-frequency features, including root mean square (RMS) and median frequency (MDF), are extracted, and K-means clustering is applied to group segments into representative muscle-state tokens. We also introduce a large-scale benchmark dataset, ActionEMG-43, comprising 43 diverse actions and sEMG recordings from 16 major muscle groups across the body. Based on this dataset, we conduct extensive evaluations to assess the inter-subject consistency, representation capacity, and interpretability of the proposed sEMG tokens. Our results show that the token representation exhibits high inter-subject consistency (Cohen's Kappa = 0.82+-0.09), indicating that the learned tokens capture consistent and subject-independent muscle activation patterns. In action recognition tasks, models using sEMG tokens achieve Top-1 accuracies of 75.5% with ViT and 67.9% with SVM, outperforming raw-signal baselines (72.8% and 64.4%, respectively), despite a 96% reduction in input dimensionality. In movement quality assessment, the tokens intuitively reveal patterns of muscle underactivation and compensatory activation, offering interpretable insights into neuromuscular control. Together, these findings highlight the effectiveness of tokenized sEMG representations as a compact, generalizable, and physiologically meaningful feature space for applications in rehabilitation, human-machine interaction, and motor function analysis."}

AoE extends classical Age of Information (AoI)-based metrics to quantum networking by capturing storage, decoherence, and probabilistic entanglement generation and swapping.\n  We study a satellite-assisted quantum repeater network in which entangled pairs are generated probabilistically, stored in quantum memories that suffer from decoherence, and combined to form end-to-end entangled links. Satellite-ground connectivity is intermittent and modeled as a two-state Markov chain. The resulting AoE minimization problem is formulated as an infinite-horizon Markov decision process (MDP), where control actions determine when to generate, store, or swap entangled pairs under stochastic link availability and memory degradation.\n  Using relative value iteration, we characterize AoE-optimal policies and evaluate their performance numerically.

To safeguard confidential transmissions, we formulate a new secrecy rate maximization problem that jointly optimizes the transmit beamforming vector and a continuous FAA shape control parameter.

While polynomials inherently possess smoothness, it is particularly interesting to investigate their behavior under convolution. This interest stems from the fact that numerous engineering and physical phenomena can be modeled through such operations, including weighted averages, blurring effects and convolutional integral equations. In this work, we show that under certain mild conditions, the convolution with any even Schwartz function acts as an automorphism on the vector space of finite-order polynomials. We derive explicit equations for the inverse operation of this convolution, which are numerically simple to implement. In addition, we extend the deconvolution with (not necessarily even) Schwartz functions to a broader class of functions, including $L^1(\\mathbb{R})$, $L^2(\\mathbb{R})$, the Schwartz space and tempered distributions. Specifically, we establish a explicit rigorous formula for the deconvolution of a function or distribution that has been convolved with a Schwartz function, being a particular example the Weierstrass Transform. For the latter, we show that any Schwartz function and tempered distribution that has been transformed, can be recovered, in their respective topologies, by the limit of a sequence of linear combination of recursive convolutions. This provides a new formula for the inverse of the Weierstrass Transform that can be numerically implemented."}

Current VHF/UHF radios and software-defined radios are popular but large-sized devices and require lots of power, making them not suitable to be used as lightweight wearable devices with seamless hand-free use. In this paper, the design and theoretical framework of a miniature, LoRa based encrypted intercommunication device that can be used in secure field communication over a range of 1-1.5km and under line-of-sight conditions is provided. The suggested system consists of a voice-activated acquisition block, digital audio compression, an embedded microcontroller processor, and AES-128 encryption followed by a low-power transmission via the LoRa protocol. Through the ability of chirp spread spectrum modulation to utilize the long-range and low-energy properties, the system is guaranteed reliable communications coupled with low power consumption and low electromagnetic footprint. The theoretical analysis of the proposed communication range is justified using a link-budget that justifies the practicability of the communication range in the real propagation conditions. This architecture focuses on infrastructural agnosticism, peer-to-peer security as well as wearable ergonomics. The given scheme shows the possibilities of LoRa technology in the scope of other traditional IoT telemetry, and it can be further extended to include secure tactical voice communication platforms."}

The channel model is quasi-static Rayleigh fading with channel state information available to the receiver but unavailable to the transmitter. We analyze the asymptotic and finite blocklength performance of two achievability schemes, one based on power-domain superposition (PDS) and another based on orthogonal resource allocation (ORA), also known as time-sharing. Upper bounds on the optimal number of blocks to transmit are derived. Algorithms to compute the optimal power and time splits for the two schemes are given. Simplified algorithms to compute locally optimal power and time splits are also given, and their outputs match those of the previous algorithms across all tested parameters. Our results show that PDS outperforms ORA, but the performance differential is less than 2% in both the asymptotic and finite blocklength regimes (Figures 4 - 6). For both PDS and ORA, numerical results also upper bound the gap between the asymptotic and finite blocklength performance by approximately 10% for n = 1000 and 3% for n = 5000 (Figures 7 - 10)."}

Shannon's rate-distortion theory provides the fundamental limit on how much a source can be compressed at a given fidelity, but it assumes infinitely long block lengths that are never realized in practice. We present a self-contained tutorial on rate-distortion theory for the simplest non-trivial source: a Bernoulli$(p)$ sequence with Hamming distortion. We derive the classical rate-distortion function $RD = Hp - HD$ from first principles, illustrate its computation via the Blahut-Arimoto algorithm, and then develop the finite block length refinements that characterize how the minimum achievable rate approaches the Shannon limit as the block length $n$ grows. The central quantity in this refinement is the \\emph{rate-distortion dispersion} $V(D)$, which governs the $O(1/\\sqrt{n})$ penalty for operating at finite block lengths. We accompany all theoretical developments with numerical examples and figures generated by accompanying Python scripts."}

Despite strong predictive performance, many models rely on statistical correlations that are unstable across acquisition settings, patient populations, and institutional practices, limiting robustness, interpretability, and clinical trust. We advocate a causal signal processing perspective in which biomedical signals are treated as effects of latent generative mechanisms rather than as isolated predictive inputs. Using clinical risk prediction as a motivating example, we show how disease-related factors generate observable biomarkers, while acquisition processes act as confounders influencing signal appearance. In clinical disease risk prediction from chest CT scans and patient risk factors, correlational models may fail under scanner changes, whereas causal abstractions remain invariant. Building on this view, we propose a unifying conceptual framework integrating causal modeling with learning-based signal processing and neuro-symbolic reasoning. Statistical models extract multimodal representations that are mapped to interpretable causal abstractions and combined with symbolic knowledge encoding clinical risk factors and guidelines. This structure enables clinically grounded explanations, counterfactual reasoning about hypothetical interventions, and improved robustness to distribution shifts arising from changes in acquisition conditions or screening policies. Rather than introducing a specific algorithm, this article presents schematic causal structures and a comparative analysis of correlation-based, causal, and neuro-symbolic approaches to guide the design of robust and interpretable medical decision-support systems."}

In this paper, we study formation design and control for Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB)-optimal cooperative target sensing. We first establish a sensing performance model based on range measurements and derive the Fisher information matrix (FIM) of the target location. By adopting the A-optimality criterion, we analytically characterize the formation geometry that minimizes the CRLB of the estimation error. The optimal formation is shown to exhibit isotropic Fisher information in the horizontal plane, leading to a regular polygon geometry with an elevation angle determined by the tradeoff between path loss and geometric diversity. Building on this result, we further develop a distributed formation control strategy that steers UAVs from arbitrary initial deployments toward the sensing-optimal configuration while maintaining formation motion and obstacle avoidance. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed scheme consistently outperforms benchmark formations in terms of CRLB and achieves reliable convergence under practical constraints."}

In commonly adopted channel models for CFmMIMO networks, inter-AP channel correlation is assumed to be absent, thereby eliminating the potential benefits of centralized processing. However, by carefully designing the pilot transmission phase, the AP received signals during pilot transmission can become correlated, and thus, centralization can improve channel estimation performance, despite the absence of inter-AP channel correlation. In this paper, we propose a channel estimation scheme, termed master-assisted channel estimation (MACE), that aims to leverage inter-AP signal correlation by means of partially centralized processing and hence improve channel estimation performance. In MACE, a subset of APs fuse and forward their received pilot signals to a master AP, which then performs channel estimation using the fused signals together with its locally received signals. This scheme strikes a balance between local and fully centralized processing by leveraging inter-AP signal correlation, while reducing fronthaul signaling and computational complexity. Numerical experiments demonstrate that MACE consistently outperforms local channel estimation, where inter-AP signal correlation is neglected."}

Two algorithms are developed: Sparse Tensor Orthogonal Recovery Method (STORM), which uses orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) for greedy support recovery, and Sparse Tensor subspace- Aided Recovery (STAR), which leverages subspace-based projection for enhanced noise robustness. Both perform joint sparse support identification, followed by a Kronecker rank-one factorization via singular value decomposition (SVD) to recover the channel parameters. Simulations show that STAR achieves oracle-assisted least squares (LS) performance at moderate-to-high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) with significantly fewer measurements than baseline methods, enabling practical BD-RIS deployment in next-generation millimeter wave (mmWave)/sub-terahertz (sub-THz) networks."}

Abstract: In [1], we introduced a NN designed to reduce the PAPR in OFDM systems. However, the original study did not include explicit generalization tests to assess how well the NN would perform on previously unseen data, which prevented a comprehensive evaluation of the model's robustness and applicability in diverse scenarios. To address this gap, we conducted additional generalization assessments, the results of which are presented in this case study. These results serve both to complement and to refine the original analysis reported in [1]. Most importantly, the overall conclusions of the initial study remain valid: the NN is still able to reduce the PAPR level to a desired reference value, also with a lower computational cost, confirming the effectiveness and practical applicability of the proposed method across a more generalized setting.

Abstract: In reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted millimeter-wave (mmWave) communication systems, the large-scale RIS introduces pronounced geometric effects that lead to the coexistence of far-field and near-field propagation. Furthermore, random blockages induce spatial non-stationarity across the RIS array, causing signals from different scatterers to illuminate only partial regions, referred to as visible regions (VRs). This renders conventional far-field and fully visible array-based channel models inadequate and makes channel estimation particularly challenging. In this paper, we investigate the non-stationary cascaded channel estimation problem in a hybrid-field propagation environment, where the RIS-base station (BS) link operates in the far-field, while the user-RIS link exhibits near-field characteristics with partial visibility. To address the resulting high-dimensional and coupled estimation problem, a reduced-dimensional sparse bilinear representation is developed by exploiting the structural characteristics of the cascaded channel. In particular, a dictionary compression technique is proposed to represent the high-dimensional coupled dictionary using a low-dimensional polar-domain dictionary weighted by a visibility matrix, thereby significantly reducing the problem scale. Based on this representation, a turbo-structured joint Bayesian estimation (TS-JBE) approach is proposed to simultaneously estimate the channel gains, VRs, and off-grid parameters, thereby avoiding error propagation inherent in existing sequential methods. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly improves the estimation accuracy compared with existing approaches.

Abstract: Xona is deploying Pulsar, a low Earth orbit (LEO) commercial navigation system designed to deliver resilient positioning, navigation, and timing (PNT) where traditional solutions fall short. Pulsar satellites broadcast dedicated signals optimized for commercial users. This brings rapid geometry change, strong Doppler observability, and robust timing, enabling new approaches to positioning even when only one satellite is visible. Internet of Things (IoT) applications often prioritize availability over sub-meter accuracy in urban canyons, semi-indoor spaces, and other constrained environments. Many platforms are battery-powered, have strict size, weight, and power (SWaP) limits, and cannot support complex multi-sensor architectures. Leveraging LEO dynamics and signal strength, Pulsar can maintain navigation capability under these conditions without specialized user hardware.
  Here we present a single-satellite positioning (SSP) concept that uses available Pulsar measurements to estimate user position and receiver clock states without external aiding. Early in Pulsar deployment, only one or two satellites may be in view, yet this still benefits stationary or near-stationary users, including in semi-indoor and indoor settings. We discuss algorithmic details and system implications: SSP enables positioning with minimal satellite visibility, reduces reliance on dense constellations, and supports integration into resource-constrained platforms. We present simulation and live sky results. High-fidelity constellation simulations configured for Pulsar provide controlled performance assessment. We also present early findings from a Pulsar-enabled receiver using observations from the Pulsar-0 satellite on orbit. Preliminary tests demonstrate meter-level accuracy outdoors and indoors, highlighting potential under varied reception conditions.

Abstract: The computation of positioning, navigation and timing (PNT) via signal of opportunity (SOP), where signals originally transmitted for communication, such as 5G, Wi-Fi, or DVB-S, are exploited due to their ubiquity and spectral characteristics, is an emerging research field. However, relying on these signals presents challenges, including limited knowledge of the signal modulation and the need to identify recurring sequences for correlation. We offer a guide to implement a receiver capable of capturing broadband downlink Ku-band signals from low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites (e.g., Starlink and OneWeb) and estimating the recurring symbols for SOP measurements. The methodology integrates recent approaches in the literature, highlighting the most effective aspects while guiding the replication of experiments even under limitations on the front-end gain and bandwidth. Using the proposed model, we can identify recurring symbols transmitted by Starlink satellites, which are then used to collect Doppler shift measurements over a 600 s interval. A position, velocity, and time (PVT) solution is also computed via least squares (LS), which achieves a positioning error of approximately 268 m after a post-fit refinement.

Abstract: In this work, we analyze a multi-functional reconfigurable intelligent surface (MF-RIS)-enabled radar and communication coexistence (RCC) system, detailing the key aspects of its phase synthesis codebook generation and the implemented localization algorithm for real-time user tracking based on density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN), which features a Kalman filter for the prediction of user mobility. We derived a 3GPP-compatible radar cross-section (RCS) and re-radiation pattern-based channel model for the described MF-RIS system, supplementing it with channel measurements. We obtained large and small-scale characteristics, including path loss, shadow fading, Rician K-factor, cluster powers, and RMS delay spread. The study finds that Sub-6 GHz indoor propagation is largely free of blind spots, even with a blocked line-of-sight (LoS) path. Therefore, the proposed channel model includes non-line-of-sight (NLoS) paths, including the ones created by the MF-RIS. We also performed an experimental evaluation of the channel throughput in a fifth generation (5G) new radio (NR) single user multiple-input-multiple-output (SU-MIMO) system, reporting a 74\% reduction in throughput variance and a 12.5\% sum-rate improvement within the MF-RIS near-field compared to the no-RIS setup. This result shows that the MF-RIS can minimize delay spread and increase the coherence bandwidth by creating virtual-LoS (vLoS) path for the moving user, thereby effectively hardening wireless MIMO channels.

Abstract: In the context of civilian and military communications, anti-jamming techniques are essential to ensure information integrity in the presence of malicious interference. A conventional time-domain approach relies on computing the Wiener interpolation filter to estimate and suppress the jamming waveform from the received samples. It is widely acknowledged that this method is effective for protecting wideband systems against narrowband interference. In this work, this paradigm is questioned through the design of a $K$-tone jamming waveform that is intrinsically difficult to estimate assuming a $L$-tap Wiener interpolation filter. This design relies on an optimization procedure that maximizes the analytical Bayesian mean squared error associated with the jamming waveform estimate. Additionally, an analytical proof is provided showing that a multi-tone jamming waveform composed of $L/2+1$ tones is sufficient to render the Wiener-filter-based anti-jamming module completely ineffective. The analytical results are validated through Monte Carlo simulations assuming both perfect knowledge and practical estimates of the correlation functions of the received signal.

Abstract: This paper investigates the role of large language models (LLMs) in sixth-generation (6G) Internet of Things (IoT) networks and proposes a prompt-engineering-based real-time feedback and verification (PE-RTFV) framework that perform physical-layer's optimization tasks through an iteratively process. By leveraging the naturally available closed-loop feedback inherent in wireless communication systems, PE-RTFV enables real-time physical-layer optimization without requiring model retraining. The proposed framework employs an optimization LLM (O-LLM) to generate task-specific structured prompts, which are provided to an agent LLM (A-LLM) to produce task-specific solutions. Utilizing real-time system feedback, the O-LLM iteratively refines the prompts to guide the A-LLM toward improved solutions in a gradient-descent-like optimization process. We test PE-RTFV approach on wireless-powered IoT testbed case study on user-goal-driven constellation design through semantically solving rate-energy (RE)-region optimization problem which demonstrates that PE-RTFV achieves near-genetic-algorithm performance within only a few iterations, validating its effectiveness for complex physical-layer optimization tasks in resource-constrained IoT networks.

Abstract: Relays are pivotal in military communication networks, expanding coverage and ensuring reliable connectivity in challenging operational environments. While traditional terrestrial relays (TR) are constrained by fixed locations and vulnerability to physical obstructions, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-mounted aerial relays (AR) offer a dynamic and flexible alternative by operating above obstacles and adapting to changing battlefield conditions. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of AR systems in military communications, presenting a detailed comparison between AR and TR paradigms and examining two specific AR technologies: active aerial relays (AAR) and aerial reconfigurable intelligent surface (ARIS) relays. The survey delves into their operation, benefits, challenges, and military applications, supported by a qualitative analysis across metrics such as coverage, flexibility, security, and cost. A novel multi-dimensional metric, the mission-critical relay effectiveness score (MCRES), is introduced as a quantitative method for evaluating relay suitability based on mission-specific weights for critical attributes like mobility, jamming resilience, deployment speed, stealth, coverage, and autonomy. Furthermore, we present Algorithm 1, a decision-making framework that leverages the MCRES to guide the systematic selection of the optimal relay type, AR or TR, and subsequently AAR or ARIS, tailored to the unique demands of a given military scenario, such as dynamic battlefield operations, electronic warfare, or covert missions. Finally, the paper addresses current implementation challenges and outlines promising future research directions to advance the deployment of robust and resilient UAV-mounted relay systems in contested military environments.

Abstract: Doppler-resilient complementary sequence (DRCS) sets play a vital role in modern communication and sensing systems, particularly in high-mobility environments. This work makes two primary contributions. First, we refine the definition of quasi-Florentine rectangles to a more general form,termed generalized quasi-Florentine rectangles, and propose a systematic method for their construction. Second, we propose several sets of aperiodic DRCS based on generalized quasi Florentine rectangles and Butson-type Hadamard matrices. The proposed aperiodic DRCS sets are shown to be asymptotically optimal with respect to the lower bound of aperiodic DRCS sets.

Abstract: The sixth-generation (6G) of wireless communication networks aims to leverage artificial intelligence tools for efficient and robust network optimization. This is especially the case since traditional optimization methods often face high computational complexity, motivating the use of deep learning (DL)-based optimization frameworks. In this context, this paper considers a multi-antenna base station (BS) serving multiple users simultaneously through transmit beamforming in downlink mode. To account for robustness, this work proposes an uncertainty-injected deep unfolded fractional programming (UI-DUFP) framework for weighted sum rate (WSR) maximization under imperfect channel conditions. The proposed method unfolds fractional programming (FP) iterations into trainable neural network layers refined by projected gradient descent (PGD) steps, while robustness is introduced by injecting sampled channel uncertainties during training and optimizing a quantile-based objective. Simulation results show that the proposed UI-DUFP achieves higher WSR and improved robustness compared to classical weighted minimum mean square error, FP, and DL baselines, while maintaining low inference time and good scalability. These findings highlight the potential of deep unfolding combined with uncertainty-aware training as a powerful approach for robust optimization in 6G networks.

Abstract: This paper develops a framework for analyzing UAV-enabled short-packet communication, leveraging fluid antenna system (FAS)-assisted relaying networks. Operating in the short-packet regime and focusing on challenging urban environments, we derive novel, closed-form expressions for the block error rate (BLER). This is achieved by modeling the spatially correlated Nakagami-$m$ fading link via a tractable eigenvalue-based approach. A high-signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) asymptotic analysis is also presented, revealing the system's fundamental diversity order. Building on this analysis, we formulate a novel energy efficiency (EE) maximization problem that, unlike idealized models, uniquely incorporates the non-trivial time and energy overheads of FAS port selection. An efficient hierarchical algorithm is proposed to jointly optimize key system parameters. Numerical results validate our analysis, demonstrating that while FAS provides substantial power gains, the operational overhead creates a critical trade-off. This trade-off dictates an optimal number of FAS ports and a non-trivial optimal UAV deployment altitude, governed by the balance between blockage and path loss. This work provides key insights for FAS-aided UAV communications.

Abstract: Consider multiple users and a fusion center. Each user possesses a sequence of bits and can communicate with the fusion center through a one-way public channel. The fusion center's task is to compute the sum of all the sequences under the privacy requirement that a set of colluding users, along with the fusion center, cannot gain more than a predetermined amount $δ$ of information, measured through mutual information, about the sequences of other users. Our first contribution is to characterize the minimum amount of necessary communication between the users and the fusion center, as well as the minimum amount of necessary randomness at the users. Our second contribution is to establish a connection between private sum computation and secret sharing by showing that secret sharing is necessary to generate the local randomness needed for private sum computation, and prove that it holds true for any $δ\geq 0$.

Abstract: This paper characterizes the fundamental limits of integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) when the transmitter is subject to an artificial intelligence (AI) representation bottleneck and the receiver employs a fluid antenna system (FAS). Specifically, the message is first encoded into an ideal Gaussian waveform and mapped by an AI encoder into a finite-capacity latent representation that constitutes the physical channel input, while the FAS receiver selects the port experiencing the most favorable channel conditions. We reveal that the AI bottleneck is equivalent to an additive representation noise, which reduces both the communication and sensing signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) at the selected port. We then derive the resulting ISAC capacitydistortion region and establish tight converse and achievability bounds under general fading models, including Jakes-correlated channels. Leveraging the spatial degrees of freedom (DoF) characterization of the Jakes' model, we furthermore prove that the port-selection gain is fundamentally constrained by the physical length of the FAS region: the effective diversity order equals the numerical rank of the Jakes' correlation matrix and increases only with the FAS length. Consequently, enlarging the FAS length allows the selected-port SNR to approach the AI-imposed ceiling, driving the achievable communication rate and sensing mean square error (MSE) toward their AI-limited fundamental bounds. Numerical results corroborate the analysis and scaling laws.

Abstract: Maximum Distance Separable (MDS) self-dual codes are of significant theoretical and practical importance. Generalized Reed-Solomon (GRS) codes are the most prominent MDS codes. Correspondingly there have been many research on constructions of Euclidean self-dual MDS codes by using GRS codes. However, the study on Hermitian self-dual GRS codes is relatively limited. Since Hermitian self-dual GRS codes do not exist for $n>q+1$, this paper is devoted to an investigation of GRS codes in the case where $n\le q+1$. First, we prove that when $n\leq q+1$, there are only two classes of Hermitian self-dual GRS codes, confirming the conjecture in [13] and providing its proof simultaneously. Second, we present two explicit construction methods. Thus, the existence and construction of Hermitian self-dual GRS codes are fully solved.

Abstract: This paper investigates the joint compression problem of a vector Gaussian source, where an individual distortion constraint is imposed on each source component. It is known that the rate-distortion function (RDF) is lower-bounded by the rate derived from the Hadamard inequality, which becomes exact when the semidefinite condition (SDC) holds. However, existing works often overlook the case where the SDC is not satisfied. Moreover, even when the SDC holds, a quantitative characterization of how correlations enable more efficient compression is lacking. In this work, we refine the results when the SDC is satisfied and derive new theoretical results when the SDC is not satisfied, thereby establishing theoretical limits for practical source compression with correlations. Specifically, we examine the properties of optimal source reconstruction and provide upper bounds on its dimension, showing that lower-dimensional reconstructions are essential for efficient compression when the SDC does not hold. Within a scalable two-type correlation (2TC) covariance framework, we prove that the probability of satisfying the SDC decays exponentially with source length, emphasizing the importance of exploring theoretical limits when the SDC is not met. Additional, we determine the component-wise correlations that a vector source should possess to achieve the Hadamard compression rate, revealing the trade-off between distortion constraints and correlations. More importantly, by deriving an explicit RDF with correlations incorporated, we quantitatively characterize the gain in compression efficiency achieved by fully leveraging source correlations.

Abstract: We investigate the fundamental task of addition under uncertainty, namely, addends that are represented as intervals of numbers rather than single values. One potential source of such uncertainty can occur when obtaining discrete-valued measurements of analog values, which are prone to metastability. Naturally, unstable bits impact gate-level and, consequently, circuit-level computations. Using Binary encoding for such an addition produces a sum with an amplified imprecision. Hence, the challenge is to devise an encoding that does not amplify the imprecision caused by unstable bits. We call such codes recoverable. While this challenge is easily met for unary encoding, no suitable codes of high rates are known. In this work, we prove an upper bound on the rate of preserving and recoverable codes for a given bound on the addends' combined uncertainty. We then design an asymptotically optimal code that preserves the addends' combined uncertainty. We then discuss how to obtain adders for our code. The approach can be used with any known or future construction for containing metastability of the inputs. We conjecture that careful design based on existing techniques can lead to significant latency reduction.

Abstract: This paper establishes the theoretical limits of channel state information (CSI) feedback in frequency-division duplexing (FDD) multi-antenna orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) systems under finite-length training with Gaussian pilots. The user employs minimum mean-squared error (MMSE) channel estimation followed by asymptotically optimal uplink feedback. Specifically, we derive a general rate-distortion function (RDF) of the overall CSI feedback system. We then provide both non-asymptotic bounds and asymptotic scaling for the RDF under arbitrary downlink signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) when the number of training symbols exceeds the antenna dimension. A key observation is that, with sufficient training, the overall RDF converges to the direct RDF corresponding to the case where the user has full access to the downlink CSI. More importantly, we demonstrate that even at a fixed downlink SNR, the convergence rate is inversely proportional to the training length. The simulation results show that our bounds are tight, and under very limited training, the deviation between the overall RDF and the direct RDF is substantial.

Abstract: We address the client-selection problem in federated learning over wireless networks under data heterogeneity. Existing client-selection methods often rely on server-side knowledge of client-specific information, thus compromising privacy. To overcome this issue, we propose a client self-selection strategy based solely on the comparison between locally computed training losses and a centrally updated selection threshold. Furthermore, to support robust aggregation of clients' updates over wireless channels, we integrate this client self-selection strategy into the recently proposed type-based unsourced multiple-access framework over distributed multiple-input multiple-output (D-MIMO) networks. The resulting scheme is completely unsourced: the server does not need to know the identity of the clients. Moreover, no channel state information is required, neither at the clients nor at the server side. Simulation results conducted over a D-MIMO wireless network show that the proposed self-selection strategy matches the performance of a comparable state-of-the-art server-side selection method and consistently outperforms random client selection.

Abstract: Near field mmWave sensing is poised to play a key role in future wireless systems, enabling environment-aware, embodied, and application adaptive operation under stringent form-factor and hardware constraints. However, achieving high spatial resolution in the near field typically requires large antenna arrays, multiple radio frequency (RF) chains, or mechanical scanning, creating a fundamental tension between spatial observability and system simplicity. This paper presents frequency as aperture clip on antenna fabric (FaACAF), a hardware efficient sensing by design architecture that synthesizes spatial aperture through the FaA paradigm using a single RF chain. FaACAF realizes a modular clip on aperture fabric, in which frequency selective clip on modules (CMs) are attached to a shared guided-wave substrate and implicitly coordinated by the instantaneous frequency modulated continuous wave (FMCW) excitation frequency. In this fabric, FMCW signaling simultaneously indexes the sensing aperture and orchestrates uplink/downlink signal distribution and echo multiplexing in a switch free, fully passive, and all analog manner, eliminating RF switching and multichannel front ends. An online self calibration mechanism stabilizes the frequency to aperture mapping under practical attachment variability without requiring full matrix calibration. Two case studies illustrate the robustness of the proposed approach and quantify the predictable sensing margin tradeoffs introduced by modular deployment. Overall, FaACAF demonstrates that near field spatial observability can be scaled through architectural coordination in the frequency domain rather than hardware expansion, providing a reconfigurable and hardware efficient pathway toward embodied sensing and integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) in future wireless systems.

Abstract: An advanced technology known as a radio frequency identification (RFID) system enables seamless wireless communication between tags and readers. This system operates in what is referred to as a dense reader environment, where readers are placed close to each other to optimize coverage. However, this setup comes with its challenges, as it increases the likelihood of collisions between readers and tags (reader-to-reader and reader-to-tag), leading to reduced network performance. To address this issue, various protocols have been proposed, with centralized solutions emerging as promising options due to their ability to deliver higher throughput. In this paper, we propose the Intelligence and Efficient Reader Anti-collision Protocol (IE-RAP) that improves network performance such as throughput, average waiting time, and energy consumption, which employs a powerful combination of Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) and Frequency Division Multiple Access (FDMA) mechanisms. IE-RAP improves the efficiency of RFID networks through techniques such as the SIFT function and distance calculation between readers. By preventing re-read tags and ensuring the on-time release of the communication channel, we effectively eliminate unnecessary collisions. Our simulations emphasize the superiority of our proposed method, it increases 26% throughput, reduces 74% the average waiting time, and lower by 52% the energy consumption compared to existing approaches. Importantly, our solution supports the seamless integration of mobile readers within the network.

Through fine-tuning, we demonstrate the generalizability of the traffic foundation models in various downstream tasks, including traffic classification, traffic characteristic prediction, and traffic generation. We also compare against non-foundation baselines, demonstrating that the foundation-model backbones achieve improved performance. Moreover, we categorize existing models based on their architecture, input modality, and pre-training strategy. Our findings show that these models can effectively learn traffic representations and perform well with limited labeled datasets, highlighting their potential in future intelligent network analysis systems.

Abstract: Split learning recently emerged as a solution for distributed machine learning with heterogeneous IoT devices, where clients can offload part of their training to computationally-powerful helpers. The core challenge in split learning is to minimize the training time by jointly devising the client-helper assignment and the schedule of tasks at the helpers. We first study the model where each helper has a memory cardinality constraint on how many clients it may be assigned, which represents the case of homogeneous tasks. Through complexity theory, we rule out exact polynomial-time algorithms and approximation schemes even for highly restricted instances of this problem. We complement these negative results with a non-trivial polynomial-time 5-approximation algorithm. Building on this, we then focus on the more general heterogeneous task setting considered by Tirana et al. [INFOCOM 2024], where helpers have memory capacity constraints and clients have variable memory costs. In this case, we prove that, unless P=NP, the problem cannot admit a polynomial-time approximation algorithm for any approximation factor. However, by adapting our aforementioned 5-approximation algorithm, we develop a novel heuristic for the heterogeneous task setting and show that it outperforms heuristics from prior works through extensive experiments.

Abstract: Understanding how environmental and operational conditions influence vessel speed is crucial for characterizing navigational conditions in the Arctic. We analyzed Automatic Identification System (AIS) data from 2010-2019 to examine vessel speed over ground (SOG). Over half of the AIS records showed zero SOG, and treating zero and positive SOG as a single continuous process can obscure important patterns. We therefore applied a two-stage machine learning framework, first modeling the probability of SOG greater than zero and then modeling SOG conditional on being positive. AIS observations were integrated with sea ice concentration, course over ground, wind, bathymetric depth, distance to coast, vessel group, and navigational status. Gradient boosted decision trees with random effects captured nonlinear environmental responses while accounting for repeated observations. The positive SOG classifier achieved strong discrimination (AUC = 0.85), while the conditional speed model explained approximately 77 percent of out-of-fold variance. SHAP values quantified covariate effects by decomposing model predictions into additive contributions from individual variables. Distance to coast and bathymetric depth were dominant determinants of both the likelihood and magnitude of vessel speed, while changes in course, vessel group, and navigational status introduced secondary variation. Wind and sea ice effects were modest. Together, these results empirically characterize Arctic vessel operating regimes relevant to speed management and corridor-level assessment.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Non-coherent over-the-air (NCOTA) computation enables low-latency and bandwidth-efficient decentralized optimization by exploiting the average energy superposition property of wireless channels. It has recently been proposed as a powerful tool for executing consensus-based optimization algorithms in fully decentralized systems. A key advantage of NCOTA is that it enables unbiased consensus estimation without channel state information at either transmitters or receivers, requires no transmission scheduling, and scales efficiently to dense network deployments. However, NCOTA is inherently susceptible to external interference, which can bias the consensus estimate and deteriorate the convergence of the underlying decentralized optimization algorithm. In this paper, we propose a novel interference-robust (IR-)NCOTA scheme. The core idea is to apply a coordinated random rotation of the frame of reference across all nodes, and transmit a pseudo-random pilot signal, allowing to transform external interference into a circularly symmetric distribution with zero mean relative to the rotated frame. This ensures that the consensus estimates remain unbiased, preserving the convergence guarantees of the underlying optimization algorithm. Through numerical results on a classification task, it is demonstrated that IR-NCOTA exhibits superior performance over the baseline NCOTA algorithm in the presence of external interference.

Abstract: We experimentally demonstrate the performance gains achieved by an in-house built reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) integrated with a real-time 5G new radio (NR) system implemented using the OpenAirInterface (OAI) framework. We first quantify the gain in throughput achievable by integrating an RIS with a 5G system. Next, we show that randomly setting the RIS phase configuration and leveraging the inherent proportional fair (PF) scheduling mechanism of 5G NR can yield near-optimal throughput, provided the throughput averaging window of the PF scheduler is chosen judiciously. This occurs because, in each time slot, the PF scheduler naturally prioritizes data transmission to the user equipment (UE) that experiences the best channel conditions, namely, the UE to which the randomly configured RIS is aligned. Subsequently, we experimentally evaluate key performance metrics, including the reference signal received power (RSRP), block error rate (BLER), modulation and coding scheme (MCS) index, and throughput, under random RIS configurations. These results confirm that even a randomly configured RIS with negligible overhead can deliver performance comparable to optimized RIS designs, in real-world 5G NR wireless communication systems.

Abstract: Medical time series such as electrocardiograms (ECGs) and photoplethysmograms (PPGs) are frequently affected by measurement artifacts due to challenging acquisition environments, such as in ambulances and during routine daily activities. Since automated algorithms for analyzing such signals increasingly inform clinically relevant decisions, identifying signal segments on which these algorithms may produce unreliable outputs is of critical importance. Signal quality indices (SQIs) are commonly used for this purpose. However, most existing SQIs are task agnostic and do not account for the specific algorithm and performance metric used downstream. In this work, we formalize signal quality as a task- and metric-dependent concept and propose a perturbation-based SQI (pSQI) that aims to detect an algorithm's performance degradation on an input signal with respect to a metric. The pSQI is defined as the worst-case value of the performance metric under an additive, colored Gaussian noise perturbation with a lower-bounded signal-to-noise ratio. We introduce formal requirements for task- and metric-specific SQIs, including monotonicity of the metric in expectation and maximal separation under thresholding. Experiments on R-peak detection and atrial fibrillation classification benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed pSQI consistently outperforms existing feature- and deep learning-based SQIs in identifying unreliable inputs without requiring training.

Abstract: A novel generative site-specific beamforming (GenSSBF) framework is proposed, which integrates a site-information-maximizing (SIM) codebook with a conditional flow matching (CFM)-based beam generator. By this framework, the site-specific radio propagation environment is learned at the base station (BS), enabling the generation of high fidelity communication beams from coarse reference-signal-received-power (RSRP) feedback provided by user equipments (UEs). In the proposed design, a low-dimensional SIM probing codebook is first constructed by maximizing the mutual information between the RSRP feedback and the site-specific channel. This design not only reduces the initial beam sweeping overhead, but also enhances the amount of channel state information conveyed through UE feedback. By treating the RSRP feedback as a conditional prior, a CFM-based generative model is further developed to explicitly capture the uncertainty in beam generation. Specifically, a small set of UE-specific candidate beams is generated by inferring the learned generative model and sampling from the corresponding posterior distribution, after which the final data transmission beam is selected by the UE. Extensive simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of both the proposed SIM codebook and the CFM-based beam generator. The proposed GenSSBF framework achieves beamforming performance nearly identical to maximum ratio transmission while requiring only eight probing beams and eight candidate beams.

Abstract: As rail transport moves toward higher degrees of automation under initiatives like the R2DATO project [1], accurate and reliable train localization has become essential. Global Satellite Navigation System (GNSS) is considered as a main technology in enabling operational advancements including Automatic Train Operation (ATO), moving block signaling, and virtual coupling, which are the core components of the Horizon Europe 2024 rail digitalization agenda. However, GNSS signal integrity is increasingly threatened by intentional and unintentional radio frequency interference (RFI). This include jamming and spoofing, which are particularly concerning as the broadcasted signal can deliberately disrupt or manipulate the GNSS signal. - Jamming refers to an intentional form of interference that induces disturbances in the GNSS band, causing performance degradation or can even entirely block the receiver from acquiring the satellite signals. - Spoofing involves broadcasting counterfeit satellite signals to deceive the GNSS receiver, leading to inaccurate estimation of position, navigation and timing information. This concern about interference is not unique to rail applications. The aeronautical sector has long recognized the risks posed by GNSS interference, with extensive documentation on its impact on navigation, landing procedures, and surveillance systems. In recent years, awareness of these risks has expanded to other transport sectors. Within the automotive industry, particularly in Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS), several studies [2][3][4] have addressed the vulnerability of GNSS against interference. Similar concerns are now emerging in the rail domain [5][6][7], especially as GNSS is increasingly adopted in safety-critical applications. In literature, several levels of actions have been explored, ranging from merely the detection of a malicious signal at the initial phase to the application of advanced signal processing methods aimed at suppressing the effects of interference [8]. In alignment with the goal of the R2DATO project, we evaluated the impact of various classes of interference signals such as amplitude modulation (AM), frequency modulation (FM), pulsed, frequency hopping and chirp signals on the GNSS observables including Automatic Gain Control (AGC) and Carrier to Noise Ratio (CNO) as measured by a Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS). However, in this work, the analysis is only limited to impact of chirp interference on GPS L1 receiver observables and detection performance.

Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) are envisioned as a key enabler for next-generation wireless networks, offering programmable control over propagation environments. While extensive research focuses on planar RIS architectures, practical deployments often involve non-planar surfaces, such as structural columns or curved facades, where standard planar beamforming models fail. Moreover, existing analytical solutions for curved RISs are often restricted to specific, pre-defined array manifold geometries. To address this limitation, this paper proposes a novel deep learning (DL) framework for optimizing the phase shifts of non-planar RISs. We first introduce a low-dimensional parametric model to capture arbitrary surface curvature effectively. Based on this, we design a neural network (NN) that utilizes a sparse set of received power measurements to estimate the surface geometry and derive the optimal phase configuration. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm converges fast and significantly outperforms conventional planar beamforming designs, validating its robustness against arbitrary surface curvature. We also analyze the impact of the measurement location error on the algorithm's performance.

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the performance of RIS-aided orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) and orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems in the presence of oscillator phase noise. OFDM is known to be sensitive to phase noise, which could limit the potential gains promised by RIS systems. OTFS, on the other hand, is a compelling potential waveform for RIS-aided systems in the presence of phase noise due to it's resilience to time-varying channels. However, the effect of phase noise on OTFS has not been fully analyzed in the literature as of yet. Additionally, no existing works in the literature consider the effect of phase noise on an RIS-aided OTFS system. Hence, we propose a joint RIS channel and phase noise estimation technique using a Wiener filtering approach. Our proposed method exploits the statistical nature of both the phase noise and the Doppler spread channel in a setup with RIS. Our numerical analysis demonstrates the significant gain of RIS-aided OTFS offers compared to RIS-aided OFDM in the presence in the presence of phase noise. Additionally, our results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed estimation technique, with gains of up to 3~dB in terms of bit error rate (BER), over existing methods in the literature.

Abstract: Next-generation wireless networks at upper mid-band and millimeter-wave frequencies require accurate site-specific deterministic channel propagation prediction. Wireless ray tracing (RT) provides site-specific predictions but demands high-fidelity three-dimensional (3D) environment models with material properties. Manual 3D model reconstruction achieves high accuracy but requires weeks of expert effort, creating scalability bottlenecks for large environment reconstruction. Traditional vision-based 3D reconstruction methods lack RT compatibility due to geometrically defective meshes and missing material properties. This paper presents Holistic Reconstruction with Automated Material Assignment (HoRAMA) for wireless propagation prediction using NYURay. HoRAMA generates RT-compatible 3D models from RGB video readily captured using a smartphone or low-cost portable camera, by integrating MASt3R-SLAM dense point cloud generation with vision language model-assisted material assignment. The HoRAMA 3D reconstruction method is verified by comparing NYURay RT predictions, using both manually created and HoRAMA-generated 3D models, against field measurements at 6.75 GHz and 16.95 GHz across 12 TX-RX locations in a 700 square meter factory. HoRAMA ray tracing predictions achieve a 2.28 dB RMSE for matched multipath component (MPC) power predictions, comparable to the manually created 3D model baseline (2.18 dB), while reducing 3D reconstruction time from two months to 16 hours. HoRAMA enables scalable wireless digital twin creation for RT network planning, infrastructure deployment, and beam management in 5G/6G systems, as well as eventual real-time implementation at the edge.

Abstract: We investigate reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) for the task of position and velocity estimation in non-LOS (NLOS) indoor scenarios, using a snapshot based multi-step estimation algorithm. We evaluate a compound RIS structure prototype composed of four RIS tiles with 1-bit phase control per RIS unit cell. Numerical simulation results taking the antenna patterns into account are presented for an 3 m x 3 m area of interest. We demonstrate that the initial grid search step using the far field assumption is not robust enough for small distances to the RIS center and propose a more robust algorithm. Furthermore, we show that the effect of the antenna pattern causes an increased position and velocity error. Our modified three-step algorithm achieves a position error of 7 mm and a velocity error of 0.12 m/s at a distance of 2 m to the RIS center under a realistic numerical propagation model.

Abstract: Non-line-of-sight sensing of human activities in complex environments is enabled by multiple-input multiple-output through-the-wall radar (TWR). However, the distinctiveness of micro-Doppler signature between similar indoor human activities such as gun carrying and normal walking is minimal, while the large scale of input images required for effective identification utilizing time-frequency spectrograms creates challenges for model training and inference efficiency. To address this issue, the Chebyshev-time map is proposed in this paper, which is a method characterizing micro-Doppler signature using polynomial orders. The parametric kinematic models for human motion and the TWR echo model are first established. Then, a time-frequency feature representation method based on orthogonal Chebyshev polynomial decomposition is proposed. The kinematic envelopes of the torso and limbs are extracted, and the time-frequency spectrum slices are mapped into a robust Chebyshev-time coefficient space, preserving the multi-order morphological detail information of time-frequency spectrum. Numerical simulations and experiments are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, which demonstrates the capability to characterize armed and unarmed indoor human activities while effectively compressing the scale of the time-frequency spectrum to achieve a balance between recognition accuracy and input data dimensions. The open-source code of this paper can be found in: https://github.com/JoeyBGOfficial/Represent-Micro-Doppler-Signature-in-Orders.

Abstract: The spherical nature of the wavefronts exhibited in the near-field of antenna arrays enables advanced beamforming capabilities, such as beampointing and beamnulling. In this paper, we exploit these properties to design a near-field beam pattern under a low exposure region constraint. We address the continuous region constraint through spatial discretization, which results in a large number of constraints that lead to prohibitive computational complexity. We propose a novel low-complexity algorithm that enables a computationally tractable beam pattern design. It uses a low-dimensional subspace representation of the low exposure region based on a singular value decomposition. Our approach achieves low complexity while providing a power received at a target user close to the optimal achievable power, yet with uniform power mitigation over the low exposure region.

Abstract: This work investigates near-field focusing using a three-dimensional (3D) large intelligent surface (LIS) across frequencies and polarizations. Specifically, the LIS elements are distributed in 3D space within a long corridor, rather than being confined to a single planar aperture, and the focal point is located at a prescribed position in the radiating near field. By formulating optimization problems under both local and global power constraints, we obtain the corresponding optima. For continuous apertures, the optimal current magnitude distribution matches time-reversal (TR) solution under the global constraint and conjugate-phase (CP) solution when the local constraint dominates. When both constraints are active, the solution assigns larger excitation magnitudes to elements closer to the illumination field. This behavior remains invariant with respect to frequency and polarization for a fixed-size LIS. These findings are consistent to the more practical case of using discretized apertures in the form of Hertzian dipole arrays, studied using both analytical results and full-wave simulation. In addition, with the CP method, specific polarizations lead to identical transverse and longitudinal resolution, in contrast, under the TR method, these quantities can differ across polarizations.

Abstract: Internet services and applications depend critically on the availability and acc uracy of network time. The Network Time Protocol (NTP) is one of the oldest core network protocols and remains the de facto mechanism for clock synchronization across the Internet today. While multiple NTP infrastructures exist, one, the "NTP Pool," presents an attractive attack target for two basic reasons, it is: 1) administratively distributed and based on volunteer servers; and 2) heavily utilized, including by IoT and infrastructure devices worldwide. We %develop measurements to gather the first direct, non-inferential, and comprehensive data on the NTP pool, including: longitudinal server and account membership, server configurations, time quality, aliases, and global query traffic load.
  We gather complete and granular data over a nine month period to discover over 15k servers (both active and inactive) and shed new light into the NTP Pool's use, dynamics, and robustness. By analyzing address aliases, accounts, and network connectivity, we find that only 19.7% of the pool's active servers are fully independent. Finally, we show that an adversary informed with our data can better and more precisely mount "monopoly attacks" to capture the preponderance of NTP pool traffic in 90% of all countries with only 10 or fewer malicious NTP servers. Our results suggest multiple avenues by which the robustness of the pool can be improved.

Abstract: Despite current security implementations, Internet activity on DoD networks is susceptible to web trackers and commercial data collection, which have the potential to expose information about service members and unit operations. This report documents the outcomes of a study to characterize web tracking occurring on Army CONUS unclassified networks. We derived a dataset from the Cloud-Based Internet Isolation (CBII) platform, encompassing data measured over a two-month period in 2024. This dataset comprised the 1,000 most frequently accessed Internet resources, determined by the number of connection requests on CONUS DoDIN-A during the study period. We then compared all domains and subdomains in the dataset against Ghostery's WhoTracks.me, an open-source database of commercial tracking entities. We found that over 21% of the domains accessed during the study period were Internet trackers. The ACI recommends that the Army implement changes to its enterprise networks to limit commercial Internet-based tracking, as well as policy changes towards the same end. With relatively minor configuration changes, CBII can serve as a more effective mitigation against risks posed by commercially available information.

Abstract: Military and disaster relief operations increasingly rely on unmanned vehicles (UxVs). It is important to develop a network control system (NCS) that can continuously coordinate and optimize the movement of UxVs based on mission objectives. However, prior research on NCS aims to always maintain a connected network topology, which limits the utility of the resulting systems. In this paper, we present an approach to systematically increase the topology flexibility for an NCS by leveraging the well-studied concept of disruption-tolerant networking (DTN). We design a DTN-compatible communication utility model that, while allowing some nodes to temporarily disconnect from others, provides for a fine-grain specification of the minimum communication frequency and the maximum hops permitted for message delivery between each pair of nodes. As such, the model supports what-if analyses before a mission to determine the best communication parameters to use for a given set of UxVs. Furthermore, we incorporate our communication model into an existing NCS and evaluate its performance in a simulated scenario involving the use of five UxVs searching for an enemy ship. The results show that our model not only enables the NCS to find the enemy ship faster but also facilitates new capabilities, such as dividing the UxVs into multiple teams responsible for different search areas.

Abstract: Rail-optimized network fabrics have become the de facto datacenter scale-out fabric for large-scale ML training. However, the use of high-radix electrical switches to provide all-to-all connectivity in rails imposes massive power and cost. We propose a rethinking of the rail abstraction by retaining its communication semantics, but realizing it using optical circuit switches. The key challenge is that optical switches support one-to-one connectivity at a time, limiting the fan-out of traffic in ML workloads using hybrid parallelisms. We overcome this through \emph{parallelism-driven rail reconfiguration}, which exploits the non-overlapping communication phases of different parallelism dimensions. This time-multiplexes a single set of physical ports across circuit configurations tailored to each phase within a training iteration. We design and implement Opus, a control plane that orchestrates this in-job reconfiguration of photonic rails at parallelism phase boundaries, and evaluate it on a physical OCS testbed, the Perlmutter supercomputer, and in simulation at up to 2,048 GPUs. Our results show that photonic rails can achieve over $23\times$ network power reduction and $4\times$ cost savings while incurring less than $6\%$ training overhead at production-relevant OCS reconfiguration latencies.

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of the Internet of Things (IoT) has brought remarkable advancements to industries by enabling interconnected systems and intelligent automation. However, this exponential growth has also introduced significant security vulnerabilities, making IoT networks increasingly targets for sophisticated cyberattacks. The heterogeneity of IoT devices poses critical challenges for traditional intrusion detection systems. To address these challenges, this paper proposes an innovative method called Adaptive Meta-Aggregation Federated Learning (AMAFed), designed to enhance intrusion detection in heterogeneous IoT networks. By employing a dynamic weighting mechanism using meta-learning, AMAFed assigns adaptive importance to local models based on their data quality and contributions, enabling personalized yet collaborative learning across devices. The proposed method was evaluated on three benchmark IoT datasets: ToN-IoT, N-BaIoT, and BoT-IoT, representing diverse real-world scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that AMAFed achieves detection accuracy up to 99.8% on ToN-IoT, with F1-scores exceeding 98% across all datasets. On the N-BaIoT dataset, it reaches 99.88% accuracy, and on BoT-IoT, it achieves 98.12% accuracy, consistently outperforming state-of-the-art approaches.

Abstract: The rise of heterogeneous Internet of Things (IoT) devices has raised security concerns due to their vulnerability to cyberattacks. Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) are crucial in addressing these threats. Federated Learning (FL) offers a privacy-preserving solution, but IoT heterogeneity and limited computational resources cause increased latency and reduced performance. This paper introduces a novel approach Cluster-based federated intrusion detection with lightweight networks for heterogeneous IoT designed to address these limitations. The proposed framework utilizes a hierarchical IoT architecture that encompasses edge, fog, and cloud layers. Intrusion detection clients operate at the fog layer, leveraging federated learning to enhance data privacy and distributed processing efficiency. To enhance efficiency, the method employs the lightweight MobileNet model alongside a hybrid loss function that integrates Gumbel-SoftMax and SoftMax, optimizing resource consumption while maintaining high detection accuracy. A key feature of this approach is clustering IoT devices based on hardware similarities, enabling more efficient model training and aggregation tailored to each cluster's computational capacity. This strategy not only simplifies the complexity of managing heterogeneous data and devices but also improves scalability and overall system performance. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, extensive experiments were conducted using the ToN-IoT and CICDDoS2019 datasets. Results demonstrate that the proposed approach reduces end-to-end training time by 2.47x compared to traditional FL methods, achieves 2.16x lower testing latency, and maintains exceptionally high detection accuracy of 99.22% and 99.02% on the ToN-IoT and CICDDoS2019 datasets, respectively.

Abstract: The rapid expansion of heterogeneous Internet of Things (IoT) environments has heightened security risks, as resource-constrained devices remain vulnerable to diverse cyberattacks. Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a privacy-preserving paradigm for collaborative intrusion detection; however, device and data heterogeneity introduce major challenges, including straggler delays, unstable convergence, and unbalanced error rates. This paper presents a Calibrated Federated Learning method with Hardware-aware Fuzzy Clustering (CF-HFC) to enhance intrusion detection performance in heterogeneous IoT networks. The proposed three-tier Edge-Fog-Cloud architecture integrates three complementary components: (1) hardware-aware fuzzy clustering, which organizes clients by computational capacity to mitigate straggler effects; (2) Fuzzy-FedProx aggregation, which stabilizes optimization under non-IID data distributions; and (3) Adaptive Conformal Calibration (ACC), which dynamically adjusts decision thresholds to balance false negative and false positive rates. Extensive experiments on ToN-IoT, BoT-IoT, Edge-IIoTset, and CICDDoS2019 datasets demonstrate that CF-HFC outperforms baseline methods such as FedAvg and FedProx, achieving over 99% detection accuracy, faster convergence, and lower communication latency. Overall, the results verify that CF-HFC effectively mitigates both device- and data-level heterogeneity, compared to existing federated learning approaches, providing accurate and efficient intrusion detection across Heterogeneous IoTs environment.

Abstract: AI Video Assistant emerges as a new paradigm for Real-time Communication (RTC), where one peer is a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) deployed in the cloud. This makes interaction between humans and AI more intuitive, akin to chatting with a real person. However, a fundamental mismatch exists between current RTC frameworks and AI Video Assistants, stemming from the drastic shift in Quality of Experience (QoE) and more challenging networks. Measurements on our production prototype also confirm that current RTC fails, causing latency spikes and accuracy drops.
  To address these challenges, we propose Artic, an AI-oriented RTC framework for MLLM Video Assistants, exploring the shift from "humans watching video" to "AI understanding video." Specifically, Artic proposes: (1) Response Capability-aware Adaptive Bitrate, which utilizes MLLM accuracy saturation to proactively cap bitrate, reserving bandwidth headroom to absorb future fluctuations for latency reduction; (2) Zero-overhead Context-aware Streaming, which allocates limited bitrate to regions most important for the response, maintaining accuracy even under ultra-low bitrates; and (3) Degraded Video Understanding Benchmark, the first benchmark evaluating how RTC-induced video degradation affects MLLM accuracy. Prototype experiments using real-world uplink traces show that compared with existing methods, Artic significantly improves accuracy by 15.12% and reduces latency by 135.31 ms. We will release the benchmark and codes at https://github.com/pku-netvideo/DeViBench.

Abstract: QUIC, as the transport layer of the next-generation Web stack (HTTP/3), natively provides security and performance improvements over TCP-based stacks. However, since QUIC provides end-to-end encryption for both data and packet headers, in-network assistance like Performance-Enhancing Proxy (PEP) is unavailable for QUIC. To achieve the similar optimization as TCP, some works seek to collaborate endpoints and middleboxes to provide in-network assistance for QUIC. But involving both host and in-network devices increases the difficulty of deployment in the Internet.
  In this paper, by analyzing the QUIC standard, implementations, and the locality of application traffic, we identify opportunities for transparent middleboxes to measure RTT and infer packet loss for QUIC connections, despite the absence of plaintext ACK information. We then propose PEMI as a concrete system that continuously measures RTT and infers lost packets, enabling fast retransmissions for QUIC. PEMI enables performance enhancement for QUIC in a completely transparent manner, without requiring any explicit cooperation from the endpoints. To keep fairness, PEMI employs a delay-based congestion control and utilizes feedback-based methods to enforce CWND. Extensive evaluation results, including Mininet and trace-driven dynamic experiments, show that PEMI can significantly improve the performance of QUIC. For example, in the Mininet experiments, PEMI increases the goodput of file transfers by up to 2.5$\times$, and reduces the 90th percentile jitter of RTC frames by 20-75%.

Abstract: Deploying expressive learning models directly on programmable dataplanes promises line-rate, low-latency traffic analysis but remains hindered by strict hardware constraints and the need for predictable, auditable behavior. Chimera introduces a principled framework that maps attention-oriented neural computations and symbolic constraints onto dataplane primitives, enabling trustworthy inference within the match-action pipeline. Chimera combines a kernelized, linearized attention approximation with a two-layer key-selection hierarchy and a cascade fusion mechanism that enforces hard symbolic guarantees while preserving neural expressivity. The design includes a hardware-aware mapping protocol and a two-timescale update scheme that together permit stable, line-rate operation under realistic dataplane budgets. The paper presents the Chimera architecture, a hardware mapping strategy, and empirical evidence showing that neuro-symbolic attention primitives can achieve high-fidelity inference within the resource envelope of commodity programmable switches.

Abstract: The transition to disaggregated and interoperable Open Radio Access Network (RAN) architectures and the introduction of RAN Intelligent Controllers (RICs) in O-RAN creates new resource optimization opportunities and fine-grained tuning and configuration of network components to save energy while fulfilling service demand. However, unlocking this potential requires fine-grained and accurate energy measurements across heterogeneous deployments. Three factors make this particularly challenging [...]. To address these challenges, we design the TENORAN framework, an automated measurement scaffold for fine-grained energy efficiency profiling of O-RAN deployments, and prototype it on a heterogeneous OpenShift cluster. TENORAN instruments an end-to-end deployment based on high-level specifications (e.g., gNB software stack and split options, traffic profiles), and collects synchronized performance metrics and power measurements for individual RAN components while the network is under controlled workloads including over-the-air traffic. Our experimental results demonstrate energy profiling of end-to-end experiments with xApps in the loop, energy efficiency differences between two RAN stacks, OpenAirInterface and srsRAN, in uplink and downlink, and core network power consumption trends.

Abstract: This paper proposes an efficient method for modeling and reconstructing the channel gain map (CGM) based on virtual scatterers. Specifically, we develop a virtual scatterer model to characterize the channel power gain distribution in three-dimensional (3D) space, by capturing the multi-path propagation environment structure and exploiting the angular-domain spatial correlation of scatterer response. In this model, the CGM is represented as a function over a set of tunable parameters for virtual scatterers, including their number, positions, and scatterer response coefficients (SRCs), which can be estimated from a limited number of channel power gain measurements at a given set of locations within the region of interest. This new representation offers a flexible and scalable modeling framework for efficient and accurate CGM reconstruction. Furthermore, we propose a progressive estimation algorithm to acquire the scatterers' parameters. In this algorithm, we gradually increase the number of virtual scatterers to balance the computational complexity and estimation accuracy. In addition, by exploiting the spatial correlation of scatterer response, we propose a Gaussian process regression (GPR)-based inference method to predict the SRCs that cannot be directly estimated. Finally, ray-tracing-based simulation results under realistic physical environments validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, demonstrating that it achieves higher reconstruction accuracy compared to conventional CGM estimation approaches.

Abstract: Due to great efficiency improvement in resource and hardware space, integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) has gained much attention. In the paper, the physical layer security (PLS) of ISAC system under communication eavesdropper together with sensing eavesdropper is investigated. The system secrecy rate is maximized by transmit beamforming design of communication and sensing signals when taking sensing security, sensing performance and transmit power constraint into consideration. To deal with the formulated non-convex optimization problem, the successive convex approximation (SCA) together with the first-order Taylor expansion and semidefinite relaxation (SDR) is utilized. Additionally, it is theoretically validated that the SDR does not yield sub-optimality in the paper. Thereafter, an iterated joint secure beamforming algorithm against communication and sensing eavesdroppers is proposed. Simulation results validate the effectiveness and advance of the proposed scheme.

Abstract: This paper investigates a multiple-input multipleoutput (MIMO) visible light communication (VLC) wiretap channel consisting of a transmitter, a legitimate receiver, and an eavesdropper. The optical input is subject to both peakand average-intensity constraints. By applying the generalized entropy-power inequality to truncated exponential inputs, we derive a novel closed-form expression for the achievable secrecy rate for general MIMO VLC configurations. To enhance transmission confidentiality, a fully-connected beamforming scheme is proposed, along with a low-complexity sub-connected alternative. Although the resulting beamforming design problems are nonconvex, they are efficiently addressed by transforming them into a sequence of convex subproblems solvable via the successive convex approximation framework. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed schemes achieve significant secrecy performance improvements compared with the benchmark scheme.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Most well-known constructions of $(N \times n, q^{Nk}, d)$ maximum rank distance (MRD) codes rely on the arithmetic of $\mathbb{F}_{q^N}$, whose increasing complexity with larger $N$ hinders parameter selection and practical implementation. In this work, based on circular-shift operations, we present a construction of $(J \times n, q^{Jk}, d)$ MRD codes with efficient encoding, where $J$ equals to the Euler's totient function of a defined $L$ subject to $\gcd(q, L) = 1$. The proposed construction is performed entirely over $\mathbb{F}_q$ and avoids the arithmetic of $\mathbb{F}_{q^J}$. We further characterize the constructed MRD codes, Gabidulin codes and twisted Gabidulin codes using a set of $q$-linearized polynomials over the row vector space $\mathbb{F}_{q}^N$, and clarify their inherent difference and connection. For the case $J \neq m_L$, where $m_L$ denotes the multiplicative order of $q$ modulo $L$, we show that the proposed MRD codes, in a family of settings, are different from any Gabidulin code and any twisted Gabidulin code. For the case $J = m_L$, we prove that every constructed $(J \times n, q^{Jk}, d)$ MRD code coincides with a $(J \times n, q^{Jk}, d)$ Gabidulin code, yielding an equivalent circular-shift-based construction that operates directly over $\mathbb{F}_q$. In addition, we prove that under some parameter settings, the constructed MRD codes are equivalent to a generalization of Gabidulin codes obtained by summing and concatenating several $(m_L \times n, q^{m_Lk}, d)$ Gabidulin codes. When $q=2$, $L$ is prime and $n\leq m_L$, it is analyzed that generating a codeword of the proposed $((L-1) \times n, 2^{(L-1)k}, d)$ MRD codes requires $O(nkL)$ exclusive OR (XOR) operations, while generating a codeword of $((L-1) \times n, 2^{(L-1)k}, d)$ Gabidulin codes, based on customary construction, requires $O(nkL^2)$ XOR operations.

Abstract: Channel State Information (CSI) provides a detailed description of the wireless channel and has been widely adopted for Wi-Fi sensing, particularly for high-precision indoor positioning. However, complete CSI is rarely available in real-world deployments due to hardware constraints and the high communication overhead required for feedback. Moreover, existing positioning models lack mechanisms to detect when users move outside their trained regions, leading to unreliable estimates in dynamic environments. In this paper, we present FPNet, a unified deep learning framework that jointly addresses channel feedback compression, accurate indoor positioning, and robust anomaly detection (AD). FPNet leverages the beamforming feedback matrix (BFM), a compressed CSI representation natively supported by IEEE 802.11ac/ax/be protocols, to minimize feedback overhead while preserving critical positioning features. To enhance reliability, we integrate ADBlock, a lightweight AD module trained on normal BFM samples, which identifies out-of-distribution scenarios when users exit predefined spatial regions. Experimental results using standard 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi hardware show that FPNet achieves positioning accuracy above 97% with only 100 feedback bits, boosts net throughput by up to 22.92%, and attains AD accuracy over 99% with a false alarm rate below 1.5%. These results demonstrate FPNet's ability to deliver efficient, accurate, and reliable indoor positioning on commodity Wi-Fi devices.

Abstract: We study the amount of reliable information that can be stored in a DNA-based storage system with noisy sequencing, where each codeword is composed of short DNA molecules. We analyze a concatenated coding scheme, where the outer code is designed to handle the random sampling, while the inner code is designed to handle the random sequencing noise. We assume that the sequencing channel is symmetric and choose the inner coding scheme to be composed by a linear block code and a zero-undetected-error decoder. As a byproduct, the resulting optimal maximum-likelihood decoder land itself for an amenable analysis, and we are able to derive an achievability bound for the scaling of the number of information bits that can be reliably stored. As a result of independent interest, we prove that the average error probability of random linear block codes under zero-undetected-error decoding converges to zero exponentially fast with the block length, as long as its coding rate does not exceed some critical value, which is known to serve as a lower bound to the zero-undetected-error capacity.

Abstract: Cell-free massive multi-input multi-output (MIMO) promises uniform high performance across the network, but also brings a high energy cost due to joint transmission from distributed radio units (RUs) and centralized processing in the cloud. Leveraging the resource-sharing capabilities of Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN), we propose EARL, an energy-aware adaptive antenna control framework based on reinforcement learning. EARL dynamically configures antenna elements in RUs to minimize radio, optical fronthaul, and cloud processing power consumption while meeting user spectral efficiency demands. Numerical results show power savings of up to 81% and 50% over full-on and heuristic baselines, respectively. The RL-based approach operates within 220 ms, satisfying O-RAN's near-real-time limit, and a greedy refinement further halves power consumption at a 2 s runtime.

Abstract: Task-Oriented Source Coding (TOSC) has emerged as a paradigm for efficient visual data communication in machine-centric inference systems, where bitrate, latency, and task performance must be jointly optimized under resource constraints. While recent works have proposed rate-distortion bounds for coding for machines, these results often rely on strong assumptions on task identifiability and neglect the impact of deployed task models. In this work, we revisit the fundamental limits of single-TOSC through the lens of indirect rate-distortion theory. We highlight the conditions under which existing rate-distortion bounds are achievable and show their limitations in realistic settings. We then introduce task model-aware rate-distortion bounds that account for task model suboptimality and architectural constraints. Experiments on standard classification benchmarks confirm that current learned TOSC schemes operate far from these limits, highlighting transmitter-side complexity as a key bottleneck.

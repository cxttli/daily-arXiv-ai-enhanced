This issue is amplified by the two-tier structure of modern GPU systems, which combine fast intra-server links with much slower inter-server networks. Motivated by recent system observations that highlight the importance of traffic reshaping and hierarchy awareness, we study all-to-all scheduling from an online switching and queueing-theoretic perspective.\n  We propose a dynamic hierarchical Birkhoff--von Neumann (BvN) decomposition framework tailored to two-tier GPU fabrics. At each frame boundary, traffic is first balanced within each server using simple local operations to mitigate micro-level GPU/NIC skew while preserving aggregate server-to-server demand. A hierarchical BvN decomposition is then applied at the server level and refined into GPU-level matchings, significantly reducing decomposition complexity relative to a flat GPU-level approach. By integrating this construction with the dynamic frame sizing (DFS) principle, we obtain an online scheduler with provable stability under admissible Poisson arrivals.

A family of imaging methods called Full Waveform Inversion (FWI), which has been developed in the field of seismic imaging, uses full acoustic wave simulations as direct models, taking into account virtually all nonlinearities, which can ultimately enhance the accuracy of ultrasonic imaging. However, the problem of cycle skipping -- the existence of many local minima of the Least Squares (L2) misfit function due to the oscillatory nature of the signals -- is worsened when FWI is applied to ultrasound data because of a lack of low-frequency components. In this paper, we explore the use of the squared Wasserstein (W2) Optimal Transport Distance as the metric for the misfit between the acquired and the synthetic data, applying the method to Nondestructive Evaluation with ultrasonic phased arrays. An analytical continuous time-domain derivation of the adjoint acoustic field related to the W2 misfit is presented and used for the computation of the gradients. To cope with the computational burden of FWI, we apply a low-memory strategy that allows for the computation of the gradients without the storage of the full simulated fields. The GPU implementation of the method (in CUDA language) is detailed, and the source code is made available. Six prototypical cases are presented, and the corresponding sound speed maps are reconstructed with FWI using both the L2 and the W2 misfit functionals. In five of the six cases, the pixel-wise sum of squared errors obtained with W2 was at least one order of magnitude lower than that obtained with W2, with an increase in the gradient computation time not exceeding 2\\%.

The micro-signals that serve as RF fingerprints are termed ``micro-CSI''. Through experimentation, we have found that the presence of micro-CSI can primarily be attributed to imperfections in the RF circuitry. Furthermore, this characteristic signal is detectable in WiFi 4/5/6 network interface cards (NICs). We have conducted further experiments to determine the most effective CSI collection configurations to stabilize micro-CSI. Yet, extracting micro-CSI for authentication purposes poses a significant challenge. This complexity arises from the fact that CSI measurements inherently include both micro-CSI and the distortions introduced by wireless channels. These two elements are intricately intertwined, making their separation non-trivial. To tackle this challenge, we have developed a signal space-based extraction technique for line-of-sight (LoS) scenarios, which can effectively separate the distortions caused by wireless channels and micro-CSI. Over the course of our comprehensive CSI data collection period extending beyond one year, we found that the extracted micro-CSI displays unique characteristics specific to each WiFi device and remains invariant over time. This establishes micro-CSI as a suitable candidate for device fingerprinting. Finally, we conduct a case study focusing on area access control for mobile robots. Our experimental results demonstrate that the micro-CSI-based authentication algorithm can achieve an average attack detection rate close to 99% with a false alarm rate of 0% in both static and mobile conditions when using 20 CSI measurements to construct one fingerprint.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Submitted to IEEE Special Issue on \"Digital Twins for Wireless Networks: Enabling Application-Aware and Closed-Loop Optimization\"", "summary": "Beamforming in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems should take interference mitigation into account. However, for beamform design, accurate channel state information (CSI) is needed, which is often difficult to obtain due to channel variability, feedback overhead, or hardware constraints. For example, amplify-and-forward (AF) relays passively forward signals without measurement, precluding full CSI acquisition to and from the relay. To address these issues, this paper introduces a novel prediction-assisted optimization (PAO) framework for beamform design in AF relay-assisted multiuser MIMO systems. The proposed solution in the AF relay aims at maximizing the signal-plus-interference-to-noise ratio (SINR). Unlike other methods, PAO relies solely on received power measurements, making it suitable for scenarios where CSI is unreliable or unavailable. PAO consists of two stages: a supervised-learning-based neural network (NN) that predicts the positions of transmitters using signal observations, and an optimization algorithm, guided by a digital twin (DT), that iteratively refines the beam direction of the relay in a simulated radio environment. As a key contribution, we validate the proposed framework using realistic measurements collected on a custom-built experimental millimeter wave (mmWave) platform, which enables training of the NN model under practical wireless conditions. The estimated information is then used to update the digital twin with knowledge of the surrounding environment, enabling online optimization. Numerical results show the trade-off between localization accuracy and beamforming performance and confirm that PAO maintains robustness even in the presence of localization errors while reducing the need for real-world measurements.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

To demonstrate the performance, the known and the proposed preprocessing methods are compared for different classification tasks on two widely used datasets, provided by the KU Leuven (KUL) and the Technical University of Denmark (DTU).

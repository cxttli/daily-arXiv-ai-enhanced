However, existing vision-based frameworks often rely\non computationally intensive models and are also sensitive to environmental\ninterference. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel, physics-guided\nand light-weighted framework that predicts the received signal strength\nindicator (RSSI) from camera images. By decomposing RSSI into its physically\ninterpretable components, path loss and shadow fading, we significantly reduce\nthe model's learning difficulty and exhibit interpretability. Our approach\nestablishes a new state-of-the-art by demonstrating exceptional robustness to\nenvironmental interference, a critical flaw in prior work. Quantitatively, our\nmodel reduces the prediction root mean squared error (RMSE) by 50.3% under\nconventional conditions and still achieves an 11.5% lower RMSE than the\nprevious benchmark's interference-eliminated results. This superior performance\nis achieved with a remarkably lightweight framework, utilizing a\nMobileNet-based model up to 19 times smaller than competing solutions.

First, the limited resources\nof road side units (RSUs) struggle to accommodate the growing and diverse\ndemands of vehicles. This limitation is further exacerbated by the information\nasymmetry between the controller and FVs due to the reluctance of FVs to\ndisclose private information and to share resources voluntarily. This\ninformation asymmetry hinders the efficient resource allocation and\ncoordination. Second, the heterogeneity in task requirements and the varying\ncapabilities of RSUs and FVs complicate efficient task offloading, thereby\nresulting in inefficient resource utilization and potential performance\ndegradation. To address these challenges, we first present a hierarchical VFC\narchitecture that incorporates the computing capabilities of both RSUs and FVs.\nThen, we formulate a delay minimization optimization problem (DMOP), which is\nan NP-hard mixed integer nonlinear programming problem. To solve the DMOP, we\npropose a joint computing resource allocation and task offloading approach\n(JCRATOA). Specifically, we propose a convex optimization-based method for RSU\nresource allocation and a contract theory-based incentive mechanism for FV\nresource allocation. Moreover, we present a two-sided matching method for task\noffloading by employing the matching game. Simulation results demonstrate that\nthe proposed JCRATOA is able to achieve superior performances in task\ncompletion delay, task completion ratio, system throughput, and resource\nutilization fairness, while effectively meeting the satisfying constraints."}

In practice, edge devices\noften exhibit unequal coherence times due to differences in mobility and\nscattering environments, leading to unequal demands for pilot signaling and\nchannel estimation resources. Conventional FL schemes that overlook this\ncoherence disparity can suffer from severe communication inefficiencies and\ntraining overhead.

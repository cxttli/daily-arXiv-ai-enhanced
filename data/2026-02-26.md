Abstract: In this paper, we present new constructions of $q$-ary Singleton-optimal locally repairable codes (LRCs) with minimum distance $d=6$ and locality $r=3$, based on combinatorial structures from finite geometry. By exploiting the well-known correspondence between a complete set of mutually orthogonal Latin squares (MOLS) of order $q$ and the affine plane $\mathrm{AG}(2,q)$, We systematically construct families of disjoint 4-arcs in the projective plane $\mathrm{PG}(2,q)$, such that the union of any two distinct 4-arcs forms an 8-arc. These 4-arcs form what we call 4-local arcs, and their existence is equivalent to that of the desired codes. For any prime power $q\ge 7$, our construction yields codes of length $n = 2q$, $2q-2$, or $2q-6$ depending on whether $q$ is even, $q\equiv 3 \pmod{4}$, or $q\equiv 1 \pmod{4}$, respectively.

Abstract: Guided wireless technology is an innovative approach that combines the strengths of guided waves and wireless communication. In traditional wireless systems, signals propagate through the air, where they are vulnerable to interference, attenuation, and jamming. Guided communication, in contrast, confines signals within a physical medium, significantly reducing interference and supporting higher data rates over longer distances. Guided wireless technology harnesses these benefits by creating guided wireless channels and offering a controlled pathway for electromagnetic waves. This work harnesses these benefits by focusing on the modeling of near-field communication through long connected arrays deployed in linear-cell environments. We derive a circuit model for long array as an infinitely long dipole with multiple periodic feed points before approximating it with a finite array through open circuiting. Through our simulations, we show how the standing wave phenomenon is confirmed by the oscillations in spectral efficiency. We also demonstrate the capability of the LMMSE transmit beamformer in mitigating interference and minimizing the mean square error by adaptively allocating more power to the user experiencing the most severe channel attenuation, resulting in a more balanced variation of achievable rates across users.

Abstract: Terahertz (THz) communications has emerged as a promising technology for future wireless systems due to its potential to support extremely high data rates. However, severe path loss, blockage effects, and sensitivity to beam misalignment pose major challenges to reliable indoor THz communications. In this paper, we investigate the coverage probability of downlink transmission in a three-dimensional (3D) indoor THz communication system under structured access point (AP) deployments, with a focus on square and hexagonal grid topologies. A tractable analytical framework is developed to jointly account for human blockages, correlated wall blockages across APs, beam training, and residual pointing error. Numerical results demonstrate that wall blockage correlation significantly reduces the association and coverage probabilities, and its impact cannot be neglected in system performance analysis. Compared with square grid AP deployments, hexagonal grids consistently achieve higher coverage by mitigating correlated wall blockage effects and reducing the distances between user equipments (UEs) and their associated APs. Furthermore, coverage performance is shown to strongly depend on the UE location, with noticeable degradation as the UE moves away from its nearest AP. Residual pointing error is found to introduce substantial coverage loss, especially for longer links. In addition, beam training analysis reveals a non-monotonic relationship between antenna array size and training overhead, highlighting an inherent tradeoff among antenna configuration, beamwidth selection, and beam training efficiency. These findings provide useful insights into the design and deployment of practical indoor THz communication systems.

Abstract: Sum-rank codes have wide applications in multishot network coding, distributed storage and the construction of space-time codes. Asymptotically good sequences of linearized algebraic geometry sum-rank codes, exceeding the Gilbert-Varshamov-like bound, were constructed in a recent paper published in IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory by E. Berardini and X. Caruso. We call this bound the Tsfasman-Vladut-Zink-like bound. In this paper, we introduce the concatenation of a sum-rank code and a Hamming metric code. Then many sum-rank codes with good parameters, which are better than sum-rank BCH codes, are constructed simply and explicitly. Moreover, we obtain an asymptotically good sequence of sum-rank codes exceeding the Tsfasman-Vladut-Zink-like bound and the Gilbert-Varshamov-like bound.

Abstract: We investigate permutation polynomials F over finite fields F_{p^n} whose generalized derivative maps x -> F(x + a) - cF(x) are themselves permutations for all nonzero shifts a. This property, termed perfect c-nonlinearity (PcN), represents optimal resistance to c-differential attacks - a concern highlighted by recent cryptanalysis of the Kuznyechik cipher variant. We provide the first characterization using the classical difference distribution table (DDT): F is PcN if and only if Delta_F(a,b) Delta_F(a,c^{-1}b) = 0 for all nonzero a,b. This enables verification in O(p^{2n}) time given a precomputed DDT, a significant improvement over the naive O(p^{3n}) approach. We prove a strict dichotomy for monomial permutations: the derivative F(x + alpha) - cF(x) is either a permutation for all nonzero shifts or for none, with the general case remaining open. For quadratic permutations, we provide explicit algebraic characterizations. We identify the first class of affine transformations preserving c-differential uniformity and derive tight nonlinearity bounds revealing fundamental incompatibility between PcN and APN properties. These results position perfect c-nonlinearity as a structurally distinct regime within permutation polynomial theory.

Abstract: The sixth generation (6G) network is expected to deploy larger multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) arrays to support massive connectivity, which will increase overhead and latency at the physical layer. Meanwhile, emerging 6G demands such as immersive communications and environmental sensing pose challenges to traditional signal processing. To address these issues, we propose the ``semantic-aware MIMO'' paradigm, which leverages specialist models and large models to perceive, utilize, and fuse the inherent semantics of channels and sources for improved performance. Moreover, for representative MIMO physical-layer tasks, e.g., random access activity detection, channel feedback, and precoding, we design specialist models that exploit channel and source semantics for better performance. Additionally, in view of the more diversified functions of 6G MIMO, we further explore large models as a scalable solution for multi-task semantic-aware MIMO and review recent advances along with their advantages and limitations. Finally, we discuss the challenges, insights, and prospects of the evolution of specialist models and large models empowered semantic-aware MIMO paradigms.

Abstract: This paper investigates single-error-correcting function-correcting codes (SEFCCs) for the Hamming code membership function (HCMF), which indicates whether a vector in $\mathbb{F}_2^7$ belongs to the [7,4,3]-Hamming code. Necessary and sufficient conditions for valid parity assignments are established in terms of distance constraints between codewords and their nearest non-codewords. It is shown that the Hamming-distance-3 relations among Hamming codewords induce a bipartite graph, a fundamental geometric property that is exploited to develop a systematic SEFCC construction. By deriving a tight upper bound on the sum of pairwise distances, we prove that the proposed bipartite construction uniquely achieves the maximum sum-distance, the largest possible minimum distance of 2, and the minimum number of distance-2 codeword pairs. Consequently, for the HCMF SEFCC problem, sum-distance maximisation is not merely heuristic-it exactly enforces the optimal distance-spectrum properties relevant to error probability. Simulation results over AWGN channels with soft-decision decoding confirm that the resulting max-sum SEFCCs provide significantly improved data protection and Bit Error Rate (BER) performance compared to arbitrary valid assignments.

Abstract: In the modern era of large-scale computing systems, a crucial use of error correcting codes is to judiciously introduce redundancy to ensure recoverability from failure. To get the most out of every byte, practitioners and theorists have introduced the framework of maximal recoverability (MR) to study optimal error-correcting codes in various architectures. In this survey, we dive into the study of two families of MR codes: MR locally recoverable codes (LRCs) (also known as partial MDS codes) and grid codes (GCs).
  For each of these two families of codes, we discuss the primary recoverability guarantees as well as what is known concerning optimal constructions. Along the way, we discuss many surprising connections between MR codes and broader questions in computer science and mathematics. For MR LRCs, the use of skew polynomial codes has unified many previous constructions. For MR GCs, the theory of higher order MDS codes shows that MR GCs can be used to construct optimal list-decodable codes. Furthermore, the optimally recoverable patterns of MR GCs have close ties to long-standing problems on the structural rigidity of graphs.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: A conflict-avoiding code (CAC) of length L and weight w is used for deterministic multiple-access without feedback. When the number of simultaneous active users is less than or equal to w, such a code is able to provide a hard guarantee that each active user has a successful transmission within every consecutive L time slots. Recently, CACs were extended to multichannel CAcs (MC-CACs) over M orthogonal channels with the aim of increasing the number of potential users that can be supported. While most existing results on MC-CAC are derived under the assumption that M is not less than w, this paper focuses on the case that M is less than w, which is more relevant to practical application scenarios. In this paper, we first introduce the concept of exceptional codewords in MC-CACs. By employing some techniques from additive combinatorics, we derive a series of optimal MC-CACs. Along the way, several previously known optimal CAC results are generalized. Finally, our results extend naturally to AM-OPPTS MC-CACs and mixed-weight MC-CACs, two classes of relevant codes.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Extremely large antenna arrays and high-frequency operation are two key technologies that advance performance metrics such as higher data rates, lower latency, and wider coverage in sixth-generation communications. However, the adoption of these technologies fundamentally changes the characteristics of wavefronts, forcing communication systems to operate in the near-field region. The transition from planar far-field communications to spherical near-field propagation necessitates novel channel estimation algorithms to fully exploit the unique features of spherical wavefronts for advanced transceiver design. To this end, we propose a novel semi-gridless channel estimation approach based on a variational Bayesian (VB) inference framework. Specifically, we reformulate the near-field channel model for both uniform linear arrays and uniform planar arrays into separate direction-of-arrival (DoAs) and distance components. Building on these new representations, we employ a gridless approach for DoAs estimation using a von Mises distribution, and a coarse-to-fine grid search for distance estimation. We then develop a semi-gridless variational Bayesian (SG-VB) algorithm with efficient update rules that enables accurate channel reconstruction. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed SG-VB algorithm, demonstrating enhanced near-field channel reconstruction accuracy and superior estimation performance for both DoAs and distance components embedded in near-field channels.

Abstract: It has been shown that WiFi devices enable sensing of environments and targets through their channel state information. However, the same devices have not been used for delay-synchronous channel sounding due to challenges related to the stability of synchronization and lack of reference power levels. Due to factors such as uncertainty in symbol reception timing, impulse responses are discontinuous across acquisitions. The present paper addresses the challenges to perform delay-synchronous channel sounding using off-the-shelf multiple-antenna IEEE 802.11ax WiFi devices, referred to as SoundiFi. Stable delay synchronization and power level reference are realized by remoting the antennas with coaxial cables and devoting one of the antennas as a reference channel, with which the gain and delay of other simultaneous channels are defined. Indoor experiments confirmed that the impulse response becomes continuous across successive acquisitions and provide the absolute delay. The impulse response has a noise level at -115 dB, indicating the maximum path gain value that can be measured with the devices. The impulse response also revealed the existence of long-delayed multipaths up to 132 m propagation distance in a reverberant 30-m-long corridor.

Abstract: This paper aims to design multiple access (MA) schemes to improve the max-min fairness (MMF) for pinching antennas (PAs)-based multigroup multicast communications, where PA placement and resource allocation are jointly optimized. Specifically, three MA schemes are considered to facilitate the multicast transmission: i) treating interference as noise (TIN), ii) non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA), and iii) time-division multiple access (TDMA) with two PA reconfiguration protocols, namely pinching switching (PS) and pinching multiplexing (PM). i) For TIN, a closed-form solution is derived for optimal power allocation, while a sequential element-wise optimization (SEO) is developed for the PA placement. ii) For NOMA, a recursive power allocation framework incorporating a bisection search is developed, and a hierarchical objective evaluation (HOE) mechanism is incorporated to simplify the SEO process for PA location update. iii) For TDMA, the PS protocol allows the PA locations to be optimized separately using the SEO method, after which the time-power allocation is solved as a convex problem with a global optimum. Under the PM protocol, the PA locations are jointly optimized with the time-power resources through a Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT)-based analytical solution. Numerical results demonstrate that: i) the pinching-antenna system (PASS) architecture significantly outperforms traditional fixed-antenna systems. ii) TDMA-PS achieves superior performance by fully leveraging the flexible PA reconfiguration and benefiting from interference-free transmission, whereas TIN serves as a practical lower-bound solution due to its simplicity despite its limited performance. iii) NOMA consistently outperforms TDMA-PM and, in high transmit power regimes with heterogeneous multicast group distributions, can even surpass the performance achieved by TDMA-PS.

Abstract: Accurate channel state information (CSI) is vital for multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. However, superimposed pilots (SIP), which reduce overhead, introduce severe pilot contamination and data interference, complicating joint channel estimation and data detection. This paper proposes a conditional flow matching receiver (CFM-Rx), an unsupervised generative framework that learns directly from received signals, eliminating the need for labeled data and improving adaptability across diverse system settings. By leveraging flow-based generative modeling, CFM-Rx enables deterministic, low-latency inference and exploits model invertibility to capture the bidirectional nature of signal propagation. This framework unifies flow matching with score-based diffusion modeling via a moment-consistent ordinary differential equation (ODE), replacing stochastic differential equation (SDE) sampling with a deterministic and efficient process. Furthermore, it integrates receiver-side priors to ensure stable, data-consistent inference. Extensive simulation results across various MIMO configurations demonstrate that CFM-Rx consistently outperforms conventional estimators and state-of-the-art data-driven receivers, achieving notable gains in channel estimation accuracy and symbol detection robustness, particularly under severe pilot contamination.

Abstract: This paper investigates a dual-hop joint visible light communication (VLC) and backscatter communication (BC) relaying framework under the finite blocklength (FBL) constraint, aiming at energy-neutral Ambient Internet of Things (A-IoT) deployments. In the proposed system, indoor LED access points are used to simultaneously provide illumination and transmit information over light to a backscatter device (BD), which harvests optical energy and backscatters the received messages to user equipments (UEs) equipped with radio frequency (RF) front ends. This forwarding of the information from VLC to RF channels is implemented without the need for carrier synthesizers and power amplifiers at the IoT node. By modeling the end-to-end communication link with short-packet IoT traffic and realistic levels of interference between adjacent VLC coverage areas, we analyze the outage performance and achievable data rate of the proposed system. Simulation results demonstrate that key factors, such as placement and orientation of the BD, as well as the selected code rate of the system affect reliability and data rate that can be achieved for communication purposes. The insights gained from this study pave the way for ambient power-enabled IoT solutions and future hybrid VLC/RF network designs.

Abstract: Millimeter-wave massive multiple-input multiple-output systems employ highly directional beamforming to overcome severe path loss, and their performance critically depends on accurate beam alignment. Conventional codebook-based methods offer low training overhead but suffer from limited angular resolution and sensitivity to hardware impairments. To address these challenges, we propose a deep learning-enhanced super-resolution beam alignment framework with three key components. First, we design the Quaternary Search-based Super-Resolution (QSSR) algorithm, which leverages the monotonic power ratio property between two discrete Fourier transform (DFT) codebook beams to achieve super-resolution angle estimation without increasing measurement complexity relative to binary search. Second, we develop QSSR-Net, a gated recurrent unit-based neural network that exploits sequential multi-layer beam measurements to capture angular dependencies, thereby improving estimation accuracy, robustness to noise, and generalization across diverse propagation environments. Third, to mitigate the adverse effects of hardware impairments such as antenna position and phase errors, we propose a parametric self-calibration method that requires no additional hardware overhead and adapts compensation parameters in real time. Simulation results show that the proposed framework consistently outperforms binary search and even exhaustive search at high signal-to-noise ratios, achieving substantial performance gains while maintaining low overhead.

Abstract: We investigate network availability (NA) in aerial heterogeneous networks (AHetNets) for effective emergency rescue, where diverse delay-constrained communication services must be provided to user equipments (UEs) with varying mobility. The heterogeneity in delay constraints and UE mobility introduces resource allocation conflicts and imbalances, which undermine communication reliability and challenge NA. Although unified resource allocation (URA) can mitigate these issues, it remains unclear whether NA can be sustained under such diverse conditions. To address this, we derive expressions for the lower bound (LB) on NA in AHetNets under URA. Our analysis reveals that extended heterogeneity significantly degrades the LB due to resource limitations-even when the heterogeneity stems from additional services under less stringent delay constraints (LSDC) or from UEs with lower mobility. To overcome this degradation, we formulate and solve a joint optimization problem for the number of UEs sharing time-frequency resources ($K$) and pilot length ($ξ$), aiming to enhance the LB by improving spatial, frequency, and temporal resource efficiency. Simulation results validate our analysis and demonstrate that jointly optimizing $K$ and $ξ$ enables AHetNets to achieve the target NA under greater heterogeneity, outperforming existing resource allocation policies.

Abstract: In this letter, a novel superimposed pilot scheme is proposed for channel estimation in multi-antenna orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) receivers. Under the assumption of a large uniform linear array (ULA) size at the receiver, the multipath components are separated directly in the angular domain. It is then shown that the proposed superimposed pilot scheme enables the computation of integrated delay and Doppler profiles by averaging the received delay-Doppler matrix across the Doppler and delay axes, respectively. This procedure helps reduce data-to-pilot interference through data averaging. Moreover, it is demonstrated that fractional delays and Dopplers of the multipath components can be estimated by correlating the integrated delay and Doppler profiles with the corresponding delay/Doppler terms. Simulation results show that the proposed approach outperforms existing OTFS superimposed pilot schemes, achieving a lower bit error rate (BER) while exhibiting a trade-off between peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) and communication performance.

Abstract: By leveraging the distributed leakage radiation of leaky coaxial cables (LCXs), the concept of pinching antennas can be generalized from the conventional high-frequency waveguide based architectures to cable based structures in lower-frequency scenarios. This paper investigates an LCX based generalized pinching-antenna system with dual-port feeding. By enabling bidirectional excitation along each cable, the proposed design significantly enhances spatial degrees of freedom. A comprehensive channel model is developed to characterize intra-cable attenuation, bidirectional phase progression, slot based radiation, and wireless propagation. Based on this model, both analog and hybrid beamforming frameworks are studied with the objective of maximizing the minimum achievable data rate. For analog transmission, slot activation, port selection, and power allocation are jointly optimized using matching theory, coalitional games, and bisection based power control. For hybrid transmission, zero-forcing (ZF) digital precoding is incorporated to eliminate inter-user interference, thereby simplifying slot activation and enabling closed-form optimal power allocation. Simulation results demonstrate that dual-port feeding provides notable performance gains over single-port LCX systems and fixed-antenna benchmarks, validating the effectiveness of the proposed beamforming and resource allocation designs under various transmit power levels and cable parameters.

Abstract: Portable ultra-low field MRI (ULF-MRI) systems operated in unshielded environments are susceptible to electromagnetic interference (EMI). Subject presence in the imaging region will lead to substantial noise increases, yet the dominant coupling mechanism remains insufficiently characterized. We develop a lumped-parameter circuit model of the coupled environment-body-receiver system. The model indicates that ambient time-varying electric fields induce a body common-mode potential, which is converted into differential-mode noise through capacitive imbalance between the head and the receive-coil terminals, yielding strong dependence on subject position and geometry. Circuit analysis, simulations, and controlled experiments support the model, with predicted imbalance consistent with measured noise variations. Guided by this mechanism, we implement a capacitive low-impedance bypass to clamp the body potential, achieving an approximately 3.5-fold SNR improvement on a 50 mT prototype. The proposed model offers a compact circuit-based tool for analyzing and mitigating human body-coupled electric-field interference in portable ULF-MRI.

Abstract: Restoring force surface (RFS) methods offer an attractive nonparametric framework for identifying nonlinear restoring forces directly from data, but their reliance on complete kinematic measurements at each degree of freedom limits scalability to multidimensional systems. The aim of this paper is to overcome these measurement limitations by proposing an identification framework with relaxed sensing requirements that exploits periodic multisine excitation. Starting from an initial linear model, a sliding-window feedback approach reconstructs latent states and nonlinear restoring forces nonparametrically, enabling identification of the nonlinear component through linear-in-parameters regression instead of highly non-convex optimization. Validation on synthetic and experimental datasets demonstrates high simulation accuracy and reliable recovery of physical parameters under partial sensing and noisy conditions.

Abstract: With the deployment of large antenna arrays at high-frequency bands, future wireless communication systems are likely to operate in the radiative near-field. Unlike far-field beam steering, near-field beams can be focused on a spatial region with a finite depth, enabling spatial multiplexing in the range dimension. Moreover, in the line-of-sight MIMO near-field, multiple spatial degrees of freedom (DoF) are accessible, akin to a scattering- rich environment. In this paper, we derive the beamdepth for a generalized uniform rectangular array (URA) and investigate how the array geometry influences near-field beamdepth and its limits. We define the effective beamfocusing Rayleigh distance (EBRD), to present a near-field boundary with respect to beamfocusing and spatial multiplexing gains for the generalized URA. Our results demonstrate that under a fixed element count constraint, the array geometry has a strong impact on beamdepth, whereas this effect diminishes under a fixed aperture length constraint. Moreover, compared to uniform square arrays, elongated configurations such as uniform linear arrays (ULAs) yield narrower beamdepth and extend the effective near-field region defined by the EBRD. Building on these insights, we design a polar codebook for compressed-sensing-based channel estimation that leverages our findings. Simulation results show that the proposed polar codebook achieves a 2 dB NMSE improvement over state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, we present an analytical expression to quantify the effective spatial DoF in the near-field, revealing that they are also constrained by the EBRD. Notably, the maximum spatial DoF is achieved with a ULA configuration, outperforming a square URA in this regard.

Abstract: Future wireless networks, deploying thousands of antenna elements, may operate in the radiative near-field (NF), enabling spatial multiplexing across both angle and range domains. Sparse arrays have the potential to achieve comparable performance with fewer antenna elements. However, fixed sparse array designs are generally suboptimal under dynamic user distributions, while movable antenna architectures rely on mechanically reconfigurable elements, introducing latency and increased hardware complexity. To address these limitations, we propose a reconfigurable array thinning approach that selectively activates a subset of antennas to form a flexible sparse array design without physical repositioning. We first analyze grating lobes for uniform sparse arrays in the angle and range domains, showing their absence along the range dimension. Based on the analysis, we develop two particle swarm optimization-based strategies: a grating-lobe-based thinned array (GTA) for grating- lobe suppression and a sum-rate-based thinned array (STA) for multiuser sum-rate maximization. Simulation results demonstrate that GTA outperforms conventional uniform sparse arrays, while STA achieves performance comparable to movable antennas, thereby offering a practical and efficient array deployment strategy without the associated mechanical complexity.

Abstract: A novel non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) based low-delay service framework is proposed for fog radio access networks (F-RANs). Fog access points (FAPs) leverage NOMA for local delivery of cached content, while the cloud access point employs NOMA to simultaneously push content to FAPs and directly serve users. Based on this model, a delay minimization problem is formulated by jointly optimizing user association, cache placement, and power allocation. To address this non-convex mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem, an alternating optimization (AO) algorithm is developed, which decomposes the original problem into two subproblems, namely joint user association and cache placement, and power allocation. In particular, a low-complexity algorithm is designed to optimizing the user association and cache placement strategy using the McCormick envelope theory and Lagrangian partial relaxation. The power allocation is optimized by invoking the successive convex approximation. Simulation results reveal that: 1) the proposed AO-based algorithm effectively balances between the achieved performance and computational efficiency, and 2) the proposed NOMA-based F-RANs framework significantly outperforms orthogonal multiple access-based F-RANs systems in terms of average transmission delay in different scenarios.

Abstract: Decentralized Federated Learning (DFL) eliminates the need for a central aggregator, but it can expose communication patterns that reveal participant identities. This work presents UnlinkableDFL, a DFL framework that combines a peer-based mixnet with fragment-based model aggregation to ensure unlinkability in fully decentralized settings. Model updates are divided into encrypted fragments, sent over separate multi-hop paths, and aggregated without using any identity information. A theoretical analysis indicates that relay and end-to-end unlinkability improve with larger mixing sets and longer paths, while convergence remains similar to standard FedAvg. A prototype implementation evaluates learning performance, latency, unlinkability, and resource usage. The results show that UnlinkableDFL converges reliably and adapts to node churn. Communication latency emerges as the main overhead, while memory and CPU usage stay moderate. These findings illustrate the balance between anonymity and system efficiency, demonstrating that strong unlinkability can be maintained in decentralized learning workflows.

Abstract: 6G is deemed as a key technology to support emerging applications with stringent requirements for highly dependable and timecritical communication. In this paper, we investigate 6G networks integrated with TSN and how to compensate for wireless stochastic behavior which involves a large intrinsic packet delay variation. We evaluate a 6G solution to reduce packet delay variation that is based on de-jittering. For this, we propose to use virtual timeslots for providing the required time-awareness. We discuss the benefits of the proposed solution while evaluating the impact of the timeslot size on the number of schedulable TSN streams.

Abstract: Network traffic analysis increasingly relies on feature-based representations to support monitoring and security in the presence of pervasive encryption. Although features are more compact than raw packet traces, their storage has become a scalability bottleneck from large-scale core networks to resource-constrained Internet of Things (IoT) environments. This article investigates task-aware lossy compression strategies that reduce the storage footprint of traffic features while preserving analytics accuracy. Using website classification in core networks and device identification in IoT environments as representative use cases, we show that simple, semantics-preserving compression techniques expose stable operating regions that balance storage efficiency and task performance. These results highlight compression as a first-class design dimension in scalable network monitoring systems.

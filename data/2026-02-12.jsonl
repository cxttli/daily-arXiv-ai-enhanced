The rapid fluctuation of the air-to-ground (A2G) link creates a regime where reliable transmission slots are intermittent and future channel quality can only be predicted with uncertainty. Conventional deep joint source-channel coding (DeepJSCC) methods transmit coupled feature streams, causing global reconstruction failure when specific time slots experience deep fading. Decoupling semantic content into a deterministic structure component and a stochastic texture component enables differentiated error protection strategies aligned with channel reliability. A predictive transmission framework is developed that utilizes a split-stream variational codec and a channel-aware scheduler to prioritize the delivery of structural layout over reliable slots. Experimental evaluations indicate that this approach achieves a 5.6 dB gain in peak signal-to-noise (SNR) ratio over single-stream baselines and maintains structural fidelity under significant prediction mismatch."}

We propose predictive-state communication (PSC), in which the transmitter and receiver maintain an explicit shared predictive state, and the physical channel is used primarily to convey innovations, i.e., corrective information that reconciles the receiver's provisional trajectory with the transmitter's realized trajectory. This viewpoint replaces entropy-rate accounting by cross-entropy accounting under model mismatch, and it introduces feasibility constraints that depend jointly on capacity, delay, and perceptual continuity requirements; the resulting operating set is typically a bounded perception-capacity band rather than a one-sided threshold. We outline the protocol and architectural implications (state identifiers, anchors, bounded rollback, and patch-based updates) and provide a stylized illustrative example to visualize the induced feasibility region and its dependence on predictive quality."}

To overcome these limitations, we develop an optimization framework that jointly controls TN downlink power, uplink power, and antenna downtilt to protect NTN links while preserving terrestrial performance. The resultant non-convex coupling between TN and NTN parameters is addressed by a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)-based reinforcement learning method that develops adaptive power and tilt control strategies.

Version of record: https://doi.org/10.1117/12.3063655", "summary": "Atmospheric turbulence and aero-optic effects cause phase aberrations in propagating light waves, thereby reducing effectiveness in transmitting and receiving coherent light from an aircraft. Existing optical sensors can measure the resulting phase aberrations, but the physical experiments required to induce these aberrations are expensive and time-intensive. Simulation methods could provide a less expensive alternative. For example, an existing simulation algorithm called boiling flow, which generalizes the Taylor frozen-flow method, can generate synthetic phase aberration data (i.e., phase screens) induced by atmospheric turbulence. However, boiling flow depends on physical parameters, such as the Fried coherence length r0, which are not well-defined for aero-optic effects. In this paper, we introduce a method to estimate the parameters of boiling flow from measured aero-optic phase aberration data. Our algorithm estimates these parameters to fit the spatial and temporal statistics of the measured data. This method is computationally efficient and our experiments show that the temporal power spectral density of the slopes of the synthetic phase screens reasonably matches that of the measured phase aberrations from two turbulent boundary layer data sets, with errors between 8-9%. However, the Kolmogorov spatial structure function of the phase screens does not match that of the measured phase aberrations, with errors above 28%. This suggests that, while the parameters of boiling flow can reasonably fit the temporal statistics of highly convective data, they cannot fit the complex spatial statistics of aero-optic phase aberrations."}

In this work, we introduce the Degree of Information Abstraction (DIA), a general metric that quantifies how well a representation compresses input data while preserving task-relevant semantics. We derive a tractable information-theoretic formulation of DIA and propose a DIA-based information abstraction framework. As a case study, we apply DIA to a large language model (LLM)-guided video transmission task, where abstraction-aware encoding significantly reduces transmission volume by $99.75\\%$, while maintaining semantic fidelity.

At the server scale, the communication demands of these workloads are increasingly outstripping the bandwidth and energy limits of electrical interconnects, driving a growing interest in photonic interconnects. However, leveraging these interconnects for all-to-all communication is nontrivial. The core challenge lies in jointly optimizing a sequence of topologies and flow schedules, reconfiguring only when the transmission savings from traversing shorter paths outweigh the reconfiguration cost. Yet the search space of this joint optimization is enormous. Existing work sidesteps this challenge by making unrealistic assumptions on reconfiguration costs so that it is never or always worthwhile to reconfigure. In this paper, we show that any candidate sequence of topologies and flow schedules can be expressed as a sum of adjacency matrices and their powers. This abstraction captures the entire solution space and yields a lower bound on all-to-all completion time. Building on this formulation, we identify a family of topology sequences with strong symmetry and high expansion that admits bandwidth-efficient schedules, which our algorithm constructs with low computational overhead. Together, these insights allow us to efficiently construct near-optimal solutions, effectively avoiding enumeration of the combinatorial design space. Evaluation shows that our approach reduces all-to-all completion time by up to 44% on average across a wide range of network parameters, message sizes and workload types."}

This expanded functionality introduces a new mode of signal propagation, enabling new forms of wireless communication. In this paper, we provide an analytical performance characterization of an E-FAS-enabled wireless link. We first develop a physics-consistent end-to-end channel model that couples a surface-impedance wave formulation with small-scale fading on both the base station (BS)-surface and launcher-user segments. We illustrate that the resulting effective BS-user channel remains circularly symmetric complex Gaussian, with an enhanced average power that explicitly captures surface-wave attenuation and junction losses. For single-user cases with linear precoding, we derive the outage probability and ergodic capacity in closed forms, together with high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) asymptotics that quantify the gain of E-FAS over purely space-wave propagation. For the multiuser case with zero-forcing (ZF) precoding, we derive the distribution of the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) and obtain tractable approximations for the ergodic sum-rate, explicitly revealing how the E-FAS macro-gain interacts with the BS spatial degrees of freedom (DoF).

At the top-level, we introduce a novel split-parallel switch architecture that spatially divides (without processing) the incoming fibers and distributes them across smaller independent switches without intermediate OEO conversions or fine-tuned per-packet load-balancing. This passive spatial division enables scaling at the cost of a coarser traffic load balancing. Yet, through extensive evaluations of backbone network traffic, we demonstrate that differences with fine-tuned approaches are small. In addition, we propose a novel HBM-based shared-memory architecture for the implementation of the smaller independent switches, and we introduce a novel parallel frame interleaving algorithm that packs traffic into frames so that HBM banks are accessed at peak HBM data rates in a cyclical interleaving manner. We further discuss why these new technologies represent a paradigm shift in the design of future internet routers. Finally, we emphasize that power consumption may constitute the primary bottleneck to scaling."}

To overcome these limitations, split federated learning (SFL) emerges as a promising solution that partitions the model into lightweight client-side and compute-intensive server-side sub-models, thus offloading the primary training workload to a powerful server. Nevertheless, high-dimensional activation exchanges in SFL lead to excessive communication overhead. To overcome this, we propose SplitCom, a communication-efficient SFL framework for LLMs that exploits temporal redundancy in activations across consecutive training epochs. Inspired by video compression, the core innovation of our framework lies in selective activation uploading only when a noticeable deviation from previous epochs occurs. To balance communication efficiency and learning performance, we introduce two adaptive threshold control schemes based on 1) bang-bang control or 2) deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG)-based reinforcement learning. Moreover, we implement dimensionality reduction techniques to alleviate client-side memory requirements. Furthermore, we extend SplitCom to the U-shape architecture, ensuring the server never accesses clients' labels. Extensive simulations and laboratory experiments demonstrate that SplitCom reduces uplink communication costs by up to 98.6\\,\\% in its standard configuration and total communication costs by up to 95.8\\,\\% in its U-shape variant without noticeably compromising model performance."}

Any feedback is greatly appreciated", "summary": "Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) can substantially improve spectral, hardware, and energy efficiency by unifying radar sensing and data communications. In wideband and scattering-rich environments, clutter often dominates weak target reflections and becomes a fundamental bottleneck for reliable sensing. Practical ISAC clutter includes \"cold\" clutter arising from environmental backscatter of the probing waveform, and \"hot\" clutter induced by external interference and reflections from the environment whose statistics can vary rapidly over time. In this article, we develop a unified wideband multiple-input multiple-output orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (MIMO-OFDM) signal model that captures both clutter types across the space, time, and frequency domains. Building on this model, we review clutter characterization at multiple levels, including amplitude statistics, robust spherically invariant random vector (SIRV) modeling, and structured covariance representations suitable for limited-snapshot regimes. We then summarize receiver-side suppression methods in the temporal and spatial domains, together with extensions to space-time adaptive processing (STAP) and space-frequency-time adaptive processing (SFTAP), and we provide guidance on selecting techniques under different waveform and interference conditions. To move beyond reactive suppression, we discuss clutter-aware transceiver co-design that couples beamforming and waveform optimization with practical communication quality-of-service (QoS) constraints to enable proactive clutter avoidance. We conclude with open challenges and research directions toward environment-adaptive and clutter-resilient ISAC for next-generation networks."}

Although PLDES offers high fidelity and generality, its slow performance has plagued networking practitioners. Existing optimization techniques either simplify the network model, resulting in large errors; or execute it in parallel using multiple processors, with an upper bound on speedup. This paper explores an alternative optimization direction that reduces the computational loads of PLDES while maintaining high fidelity. Our key insight is that, in distributed LLM training, packet-level traffic behaviors often exhibit repetitive contention patterns and steady-states where flow rates stabilize, ignoring these redundant discrete events speeds up the simulation considerably and the error is negligible. We realize this idea by proposing Wormhole, a user-transparent PLDES kernel capable of automatically memoization for unsteady-states and skipping for steady-states. Wormhole adopts network partitioning, state memoization and reuse, and rate-based steady-state identification to accurately determine the periods of each flow's steady-state, while maintaining simulation consistency after fast-forwarding. Experiments demonstrate that Wormhole can achieve a 744x speedup over the original ns-3 (510x for MoE workload), with a bounded error of <1%. Applying current multithreading parallel techniques and Wormhole together allows a 1012x speedup, reducing the simulation time for one GPT-13B training under 128 GPUs from 9 hours to 5 minutes."}

The resulting instantaneous signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) model explicitly captures folded cascaded amplifier noise and reveals a finite high-gain SINR ceiling.\n  To guarantee a target outage level, we formulate a chance-constrained max-SINR design that jointly optimizes the binary RIS configuration and a common amplification gain. The chance constraint is handled using a sample-average approximation (SAA) with a violation budget. The resulting feasibility problem is solved as a mixed-integer second-order cone program (MISOCP) within a bisection search over the SINR threshold. Practical implementation is enforced by restricting the gain to an admissible range determined by small-signal stability and effective isotropic radiated power (EIRP) limits.\n  We also derive realization-wise SINR envelopes based on eigenvalue and l1-norm bounds, which provide interpretable performance limits and fast diagnostics. Monte Carlo results show that these envelopes tightly bound the simulated SINR, reproduce the predicted saturation behavior, and quantify performance degradation as interference increases. Overall, the paper provides a solver-ready, reliability-targeting design methodology whose achieved reliability is validated through out-of-sample Monte Carlo testing under realistic randomness and hardware constraints."}

To address this challenge, we develop the maximum-likelihood Gaussian-phase approximate (ML-G) detector, a low-complexity detection rule that accurately approximates maximum-likelihood detection while remaining suitable for practical implementation. The proposed detector explicitly incorporates the statistical properties of the interference and induces decision regions that differ significantly from those arising under conventional metrics. Building on the ML-G framework, we further investigate constellation design under interference-aware detection and formulate an optimization problem that seeks symbol placements that minimize the symbol error probability subject to an average energy constraint.

This tutorial-survey introduces the concept of AI infrastructure sovereignty, defined as the ability of a region, operator, or nation to exercise operational control over AI systems within physical and environmental limits. The paper argues that sovereignty emerges from the co-design of three layers: AI-oriented data centers, optical transport networks, and automation frameworks that provide real-time visibility and control. We analyze how AI workloads reshape data center design, driving extreme power densities, advanced cooling requirements, and tighter coupling to local energy systems, with sustainability metrics such as carbon intensity and water usage acting as hard deployment boundaries. We then examine optical networks as the backbone of distributed AI, showing how latency, capacity, failure domains, and jurisdictional control define practical sovereignty limits. Building on this foundation, the paper positions telemetry, agentic AI, and digital twins as enablers of operational sovereignty through validated, closed-loop control across compute, network, and energy domains. The tutorial concludes with a reference architecture for sovereign AI infrastructure that integrates telemetry pipelines, agent-based control, and digital twins, framing sustainability as a first-order design constraint."}

Eldar"], "title": "Bayesian Signal Component Decomposition via Diffusion-within-Gibbs Sampling", "comment": "13 pages, 2 figures. Submitted to journal", "summary": "In signal processing, the data collected from sensing devices is often a noisy linear superposition of multiple components, and the estimation of components of interest constitutes a crucial pre-processing step. In this work, we develop a Bayesian framework for signal component decomposition, which combines Gibbs sampling with plug-and-play (PnP) diffusion priors to draw component samples from the posterior distribution. Unlike many existing methods, our framework supports incorporating model-driven and data-driven prior knowledge into the diffusion prior in a unified manner. Moreover, the proposed posterior sampler allows component priors to be learned separately and flexibly combined without retraining. Under suitable assumptions, the proposed DiG sampler provably produces samples from the posterior distribution. We also show that DiG can be interpreted as an extension of a class of recently proposed diffusion-based samplers, and that, for suitable classes of sensing operators, DiG better exploits the structure of the measurement model. Numerical experiments demonstrate the superior performance of our method over existing approaches."}

In this sense, any network links might fail. Besides, a signal can only travel a maximum distance before its quality falls below a certain threshold, necessitating its regeneration by regenerators installed at network nodes. In addition, the price of installing and maintaining regenerators belongs to a discrete uncertainty set. Robust optimization seeks a solution with guaranteed performance against all scenarios modeled in an uncertainty set. Thus, the problem is to find a subset of nodes with minimum cost for the placement of the regenerator, ensuring that all nodes can communicate even if a subset of network links fails. To solve the problem optimally, we propose two solution approaches, including one flow-based and one cut-based integer programming formulation, as well as their iterative exact method. Our theoretical and experimental results show the effectiveness of our methods."}

A multi-antenna base station (BS) with transmitting fluid antennas serves downlink users, energizes passive tags, and illuminates radar targets, while a spatially separated multi-antenna reader decodes tag backscatter and processes radar echoes to avoid the strong self-interference that would otherwise obscure weak returns at the BS. The coexistence of tags and targets, however, induces severe near--far disparities and multi-signal interference, which can be mitigated by fluid antennas through additional spatial degrees of freedom that reshape the multi-hop channels. We formulate a transmit-power minimization problem that jointly optimizes the BS information beamformers, sensing covariance matrix, reader receive beamformers, tag reflection coefficients, and fluid-antenna (FA) positions under heterogeneous quality of service constraints for communication, backscatter, and sensing, as well as energy-harvesting and FA geometry requirements. To tackle the resulting non-convex problem, we develop an alternating-optimization block-coordinate framework that solves four tractable subproblems using semidefinite relaxation, majorization--minimization, and successive convex approximation. Numerical results show consistent transmit-power savings over fixed-position antennas and zero-forcing baselines, achieving about 13.7% and 54.5% reductions, respectively."}

The accuracy of registration data directly impacts Internet operation, management, security, and optimization. In addition, the scarcity of IP addresses has brought into focus conflicts between RIR policy and IP registration ownership and use. The tension between a free-market based approach to address allocation versus policies to promote fairness and regional equity has resulted in court litigation that threatens the very existence of the RIR system.\n  We develop WHEREIS, a measurement-based approach to geolocate delegated IPv4 and IPv6 prefixes at an RIR-region granularity and systematically study where addresses are used post-allocation and the extent to which registration information is accurate. We define a taxonomy of registration ``geo-consistency'' that compares a prefix's measured geolocation to the allocating RIR's coverage region as well as the registered organization's location. While in aggregate over 98% of the prefixes we examine are consistent with our geolocation inferences, there is substantial variation across RIRs and we focus on AFRINIC as a case study. IPv6 registrations are no more consistent than IPv4, suggesting that structural, rather than technical, issues play an important role in allocations. We solicit additional information on inconsistent prefixes from network operators, IP leasing providers, and collaborate with three RIRs to obtain validation. We further show that the inconsistencies we discover manifest in three commercial geolocation databases. By improving the transparency around post-allocation prefix use, we hope to improve applications that use IP registration data and inform ongoing discussions over in-region address use and policy."}

Despite this development, most of the current literature on antennas and reflecting structures relies on simplified models, whose validity for real systems remains unclear. In this paper, we introduce a physically consistent near-field model, which we use to evaluate commonly used models. Our results indicate that common models are sufficient for basic beamfocusing, but fail to accurately predict the sidelobes and frequency dependence of reflecting structures."}

When both endpoints possess strong predictors -- as in modern large language models and related generative priors -- literal symbol transport is no longer the only operational regime. We propose predictive-state communication (PSC), in which the transmitter and receiver maintain an explicit shared predictive state, and the physical channel is used primarily to convey innovations, i.e., corrective information that reconciles the receiver's provisional trajectory with the transmitter's realized trajectory. This viewpoint replaces entropy-rate accounting by cross-entropy accounting under model mismatch, and it introduces feasibility constraints that depend jointly on capacity, delay, and perceptual continuity requirements; the resulting operating set is typically a bounded perception-capacity band rather than a one-sided threshold. We outline the protocol and architectural implications (state identifiers, anchors, bounded rollback, and patch-based updates) and provide a stylized illustrative example to visualize the induced feasibility region and its dependence on predictive quality."}

In this paper, a lightweight hardware-efficient error-correction code encoder is designed and analyzed. Particularly, a Reed-Muller code RM(1,3) encoder is implemented with SFQ digital logic. The proposed RM(1,3) encoder converts a 4-bit message into an 8-bit codeword and can detect and correct up to 3- and 1-bit errors, respectively. This encoder circuit is designed using MIT-LL SFQ5ee process and SuperTools/ColdFlux RSFQ cell library. A simulation framework integrating JoSIM simulator and MATLAB script for automated data collection and analysis, is proposed to study the performance of RM(1,3) encoder. The proposed encoder improves the probability of having no bit errors by 6.7% as compared to an encoder-less design under $\\pm20\\%$ PPV. With $\\pm15\\%$ and lower PPV, the proposed encoder could correct all errors with at least 99.1% probability. The impact of fabrication defects such as open circuit faults on the encoder circuit is also studied using the proposed framework."}

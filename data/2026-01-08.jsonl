A pair of linear codes is called a linear complementary pair (in short LCP) of codes if their intersection is trivial and the sum of their dimensions equals the dimension of the ambient space. Equivalently, the two codes form an LCP if the direct sum of these two codes is equal to the entire space. In this paper, we introduce the concept of LCPs of subspace codes. We first provide a characterization of subspace codes that form an LCP. Furthermore, we present a sufficient condition for the existence of an LCP of subspace codes based on a complement function on a subspace code. In addition, we give several constructions of LCPs for subspace codes using various techniques and provide an application to insertion error correction."}

In this regime, signals exhibit spherical wave propagation, unlike the planar waves in conventional far-field systems. Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) can dynamically adjust phase shifts to support NFC beamfocusing, concentrating signal energy at specific spatial coordinates. However, effective RIS utilization depends on both rapid channel state information (CSI) estimation and proactive blockage mitigation, which occur on inherently different timescales. CSI varies at millisecond intervals due to small-scale fading, while blockage events evolve over seconds, posing challenges for conventional single-level control algorithms. To address this issue, we propose a dual-transformer (DT) hierarchical framework that integrates two specialized transformer models within a hierarchical deep reinforcement learning (HDRL) architecture, referred to as the DT-HDRL framework. A fast-timescale transformer processes ray-tracing data for rapid CSI estimation, while a vision transformer (ViT) analyzes visual data to predict impending blockages. In HDRL, the high-level controller selects line-of-sight (LoS) or RIS-assisted non-line-of-sight (NLoS) transmission paths and sets goals, while the low-level controller optimizes base station (BS) beamfocusing and RIS phase shifts using instantaneous CSI. This dual-timescale coordination maximizes spectral efficiency (SE) while ensuring robust performance under dynamic conditions. Simulation results demonstrate that our approach improves SE by approximately 18% compared to single-timescale baselines, while the proposed blockage predictor achieves an F1-score of 0.92, providing a 769 ms advance warning window in dynamic scenarios."}

In the context of the widely recognized vertical heterogeneous network (VHetNet) architecture, HAPS systems can provide service to both aerial and ground users. However, integrating HAPS systems as a core element in the VHetNet architecture presents a considerable energy challenge, marking a prominent constraint for their operation. Driven by this challenge, we introduce an energy harvesting (EH) strategy tailored for HAPS systems, enabling a HAPS system to gather energy from another HAPS system, which is not constrained by energy limitations. To assess the performance capabilities of the proposed model, we derive outage probability (OP), ergodic capacity (EC) and verify them by using Monte Carlo (MC) simulations. Moreover, we explore the system in terms of throughput. The findings reveal that harnessing full potential of EH stands as a viable approach to meet the energy demands of HAPS systems."}

This paper presents an enhanced XPM model that explicitly incorporates frequency-domain IF growth along the fiber, improving upon prior models that focused primarily on temporal pulse deformation. A direct correlation between this frequency-domain growth and XPM-induced phase distortions is established and analyzed. Results demonstrate that IF evolution, particularly at lower frequencies, profoundly affects XPM phase fluctuation spectra and phase variance. Validated through simulations, the model accurately predicts these spectral characteristics across various system parameters. Furthermore, the derived phase variance enables accurate prediction of system performance in terms of Bit Error Ratio (BER). These findings highlight the necessity of modeling frequency-domain IF evolution to accurately characterize XPM impairments, offering guidance for the design of advanced optical networks."}

To address this fundamental bottleneck, we propose a flexible-duplex cell-free (CF) architecture in which each distributed access point (AP) can dynamically operate either as a receive AP for UAV uplink collection or as a transmit AP that generates cooperative artificial noise (AN) for secrecy enhancement. Such AP-level duplex flexibility introduces an additional spatial degree of freedom that enables distributed and adaptive protection against wiretapping in LAWNs. Building upon this architecture, we formulate a max-min secrecy-rate problem that jointly optimizes AP mode selection, receive combining, and AN covariance design. This tightly coupled and nonconvex optimization is tackled by first deriving the optimal receive combiners in closed form, followed by developing a penalty dual decomposition (PDD) algorithm with guaranteed convergence to a stationary solution. To further reduce computational burden, we propose a low-complexity sequential scheme that determines AP modes via a heuristic metric and then updates the AN covariance matrices through closed-form iterations embedded in the PDD framework.

In the batch setting, we further require that any multiset of size $t$ of stored symbols can be recovered from $t$ disjoint subsets of servers. This framework unifies and extends several well-known code families, including one-step majority-logic decodable codes, (functional) PIR codes, and (functional) batch codes.\n  In this paper, we determine the minimum code length for some small values of $k$ and $t$, characterize structural properties of codes attaining this optimum, and derive bounds that show the trade-offs between length, dimension, minimum distance, and $t$.

Abstract: Interest in the hulls of linear codes has been growing rapidly. More is known when the inner product is Euclidean than Hermitian. A shift to the latter is gaining traction. The focus is on a code whose Hermitian hull dimension and dual distance can be systematically determined. Such a code can serve as an ingredient in designing the parameters of entanglement-assisted quantum error-correcting codes (EAQECCs).
  We use tools from algebraic function fields of one variable to efficiently determine a good lower bound on the Hermitian hull dimensions of generalized rational algebraic geometry (AG) codes. We identify families of AG codes whose hull dimensions can be well estimated by a lower bound. Given such a code, the idea is to select a set of evaluation points for which the residues of the Weil differential associated with the Hermitian dual code has an easily verifiable property.
  The approach allows us to construct codes with designed Hermitian hull dimensions based on known results on Reed-Solomon codes and their generalization. Using the Hermitian method on these maximum distance separable (MDS) codes with designed hull dimensions yields two families of MDS EAQECCs. We confirm that the excellent parameters of the quantum codes from these families are new.

Abstract: Let $p$ be a prime and $s,m,n$ be positive integers. This paper studies quasi-recursive MDS matrices over Galois rings $GR(p^{s}, p^{sm})$ and proposes various direct construction methods for such matrices. The construction is based on skew polynomial rings $GR(p^{s}, p^{sm})[X;σ]$, whose rich factorization properties and enlarged class of polynomials are used to define companion matrices generating quasi-recursive MDS matrices. First, two criteria are established for characterizing polynomials that yield recursive MDS matrices, generalizing existing results, and then an additional criterion is derived in terms of the right roots of the associated Wedderburn polynomial. Using these criteria, methods are developed to construct skew polynomials that give rise to quasi-recursive MDS matrices over Galois rings. This framework extends known constructions to the non-commutative setting and significantly enlarges the family of available matrices, with potential applications to efficient diffusion layers in cryptographic primitives. The results are particularly relevant for practical implementations when $s = 1$ and $p = 2$, i.e., over the finite field $\mathbb{F}_{2^m}$, which is of central interest in real-world cryptographic applications.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We propose a unified theory of generalized weights for linear codes endowed with an arbitrary distance. Instead of relying on supports or anticodes, the weights of a code are defined via the intersections of the code with a chosen family of spaces, which we call a test family. The choice of test family determines the properties of the corresponding generalized weights and the characteristics of the code that they capture. In this general framework, we prove that generalized weights are weakly increasing and that certain subsequences are strictly increasing. We also prove a duality result reminiscent of Wei's Duality Theorem. The corresponding properties of generalized Hamming and rank-metric weights follow from our general results by selecting optimal anticodes as a test family. For sum-rank metric codes, we propose a test family that results in generalized weights that are closely connected to -- but not always the same as -- the usual generalized weights. This choice allows us to extend the known duality results for generalized sum-rank weights to some sum-rank-metric codes with a nonzero Hamming component. Finally, we explore a family of generalized weights obtained by intersecting the underlying code with MDS or MRD codes.

Abstract: Recently, several studies have shown that when $q\equiv3\pmod{4}$, the function $F_r(x)=x^r+x^{r+\frac{q-1}{2}}$ defined over $\mathbb{F}_q$ is locally-APN and has boomerang uniformity at most~$2$. In this paper, we extend these results by showing that if there is at most one $x\in \mathbb{F}_q$ with $χ(x)=χ(x+1)=1$ satisfying $(x+1)^r - x^r = b$ for all $b\in \mathbb{F}_q^*$ and $\gcd(r,q-1)\mid 2$, then $F_r$ is locally-APN with boomerang uniformity at most $2$. Moreover, we study the differential spectra of $F_3$ and $F_{\frac{2q-1}{3}}$, and the boomerang spectrum of $F_2$ when $p=3$.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Massive machine-type communications (mMTC) demand robust solutions to support extensive connectivity efficiently. Unsourced random access (URA) has emerged as a promising approach, delivering high spectral and energy efficiency. Among URA code structures, the random spreading (RS) category is a key enabler, providing strong anti-interference capabilities through spectrum spreading gain. Notably, RS-URA approaches theoretical performance limits over the Gaussian multiple access channel in scenarios with few active users. In this paper, we propose an iterative Gaussian approximation decoder designed universally for RS-URA categories. The proposed receiver iterates extrinsic and intrinsic soft information to enhance decoding performance, requiring only a few iterations to converge. Numerical results validate the decoder's effectiveness in terms of performance and robustness.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC) technique has gained significant traction for producing diverse content. However, existing AIGC services typically operate within a centralized framework, resulting in high response times. To address this issue, we integrate collaborative Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) technology to reduce processing delays for AIGC services. Current collaborative MEC methods primarily support single-server offloading or facilitate interactions among fixed Edge Servers (ESs), limiting flexibility and resource utilization across all ESs to meet the varying computing and networking requirements of AIGC services. We propose AMCoEdge, an adaptive multi-server collaborative MEC approach to enhancing AIGC service efficiency. The AMCoEdge fully utilizes the computing and networking resources across all ESs through adaptive multi-ES selection and dynamic workload allocation, thereby minimizing the offloading make-span of AIGC services. Our design features an online distributed algorithm based on deep reinforcement learning, accompanied by theoretical analyses that confirm an approximate linear time complexity. Simulation results show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving at least an 11.04% reduction in task offloading make-span and a 44.86% decrease in failure rate. Additionally, we develop a distributed prototype system to implement and evaluate our AMCoEdge method for real AIGC service execution, demonstrating service delays that are 9.23% - 31.98% lower than the three representative methods.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: This paper investigates an information update system in which a mobile device monitors a physical process and sends status updates to an access point (AP). A fundamental trade-off arises between the timeliness of the information maintained at the AP and the update cost incurred at the device. To address this trade-off, we propose an online algorithm that determines when to transmit updates using only available observations. The proposed algorithm asymptotically achieves the optimal competitive ratio against an adversary that can simultaneously manipulate multiple sources of uncertainty, including the operation duration, the information staleness, the update cost, and the availability of update opportunities. Furthermore, by incorporating machine learning (ML) advice of unknown reliability into the design, we develop an ML-augmented algorithm that asymptotically attains the optimal consistency-robustness trade-off, even when the adversary can additionally corrupt the ML advice. The optimal competitive ratio scales linearly with the range of update costs, but is unaffected by other uncertainties. Moreover, an optimal competitive online algorithm exhibits a threshold-like response to the ML advice: it either fully trusts or completely ignores the ML advice, as partially trusting the advice cannot improve the consistency without severely degrading the robustness. Extensive simulations in stochastic settings further validate the theoretical findings in the adversarial environment.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Autonomous AI agents lack traceable accountability mechanisms, creating a fundamental dilemma where systems must either operate as ``downgraded tools'' or risk real-world abuse. This vulnerability stems from the limitations of traditional key-based authentication, which guarantees neither the operator's physical identity nor the agent's code integrity. To bridge this gap, we propose BAID (Binding Agent ID), a comprehensive identity infrastructure establishing verifiable user-code binding. BAID integrates three orthogonal mechanisms: local binding via biometric authentication, decentralized on-chain identity management, and a novel zkVM-based Code-Level Authentication protocol. By leveraging recursive proofs to treat the program binary as the identity, this protocol provides cryptographic guarantees for operator identity, agent configuration integrity, and complete execution provenance, thereby effectively preventing unauthorized operation and code substitution. We implement and evaluate a complete prototype system, demonstrating the practical feasibility of blockchain-based identity management and zkVM-based authentication protocol.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Recently, filter bank multi-carrier spread spectrum (FBMC-SS) technology has been proposed for use in ultra-wideband (UWB) communication systems. It has been noted that, due to the spectral partitioning properties of the filter banks, a UWB signal can be synthesized and processed using a parallel set of signal processors operating at a moderate rate. This transceiver architecture can be used to generate UWB signals, without requiring a high-rate analog-to-digital and/or digital-to-analog converter. In this paper, beginning with a design operating on a single signal processor, we explore the development of a packet detector using the Rao score test. Taking advantage of the FBMC-SS signal structure, an effective detector design based on a cascade channelizer is proposed. We refer to this design as singe-radio band (SRB) detector. Given the typical bandwidth of UWB systems ($\bf 500$~MHz or wider), the SRB detector has to operate at a fast sampling rate of greater than $\bf 500$~MHz. This may be undesirable, as low cost analog-to-digital (ADC) and digital-to-analog (DAC) converters are often limited to a sampling rate of $\bf 200$~MHz or lower. Taking note of this point, the proposed SRB detector is extended to a multi-radio band (MRB) detector, where a set of parallel signal processors operating at a moderate sampling rate are used for a more practical implementation of the detector. Through computer simulations, we show that SRB and MRB detectors have the same performance in typical UWB channels. Finally, we provide results from an over-the-air demonstration of a UWB design occupying $\bf 1.28$~GHz of bandwidth. We find that reliable detection performance is possible in the harshest environments, at signal-to-noise ratios as low as $\bf -40$~dB with a preamble length of approximately half the duration of longest preamble length recommended in the IEEE802.15.4 standard.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Assessing homophily in large-scale networks is central to understanding structural regularities in graphs, and thus inform the choice of models (such as graph neural networks) adopted to learn from network data. Evaluation of smoothness metrics requires access to the entire network topology and node features, which may be impractical in several large-scale, dynamic, resource-limited, or privacy-constrained settings. In this work, we propose a sampling-based framework to estimate homophily via the Dirichlet energy (Laplacian-based total variation) of graph signals, leveraging the Horvitz-Thompson (HT) estimator for unbiased inference from partial graph observations. The Dirichlet energy is a so-termed total (of squared nodal feature deviations) over graph edges; hence, estimable under general network sampling designs for which edge-inclusion probabilities can be analytically derived and used as weights in the proposed HT estimator. We establish that the Dirichlet energy can be consistently estimated from sampled graphs, and empirically study other heterophily measures as well. Experiments on several heterophilic benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed HT estimators in reliably capturing homophilic structure (or lack thereof) from sampled network measurements.

Abstract: In communication networks, channel estimation and user localization are challenging problems in harsh environments or signal-blocked areas. This paper introduces a novel approach to minimize the Mean Squared Error (MSE) in channel estimation between mobile users and rectangular Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS) within wireless communication systems. Meanwhile, the user localization is realized based on the estimated Channel State Information (CSI). In this paper, we assume a non-linear, user's position-dependent system model, for a user with high mobility, an RIS with multiple elements, and a base station (BS) with multiple antennas. After that, we apply the Kalman Filtering (KF) like algorithms to reduce MSE in estimating parameters of this time-variant channel model. Additionally, we propose a Non-Circular Noise Kalman Filter (NCNKF) to address scenarios with non-circular complex state-space noise. Furthermore, we apply the Discrete Space Fourier Transform (DSFT) method, combined with the interpolation techniques to decrease the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) for the user localization based on the estimated CSI. Finally, we extend the single-user case into the multi-user situation. Results show that KF can achieve lower MSE in estimating the channel than other known approaches, while the NCNKF algorithm has better performance in non-circular state-space noise scenarios. At the same time, the DSFT interpolation outperforms the other approaches with lower complexity. The study concludes with numerical comparisons and an in-depth discussion of the performance improvements enabled by our approaches.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Ambient backscatter communication (AmBC) enables battery-free connectivity by letting passive tags modulate existing RF signals, but reliable detection of multiple tags is challenging due to strong direct link interference, very weak backscatter signals, and an exponentially large joint state space. Classical multi-hypothesis likelihood ratio tests (LRTs) are optimal for this task when perfect channel state information (CSI) is available, yet in AmBC such CSI is difficult to obtain and track because the RF source is uncooperative and the tags are low-power passive devices. We first derive analytical performance bounds for an LRT receiver with perfect CSI to serve as a benchmark. We then propose two complementary deep learning frameworks that relax the CSI requirement while remaining modulation-agnostic. EmbedNet is an end-to-end prototypical network that maps covariance features of the received signal directly to multi-tag states. ChanEstNet is a hybrid scheme in which a convolutional neural network estimates effective channel coefficients from pilot symbols and passes them to a conventional LRT for interpretable multi-hypothesis detection. Simulations over diverse ambient sources and system configurations show that the proposed methods substantially reduce bit error rate, closely track the LRT benchmark, and significantly outperform energy detection baselines, especially as the number of tags increases.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We consider vehicular networking scenarios where existing vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) links can be leveraged for an effective uploading of large-size data to the network. In particular, we consider a group of vehicles where one vehicle can be designated as the \textit{leader} and other \textit{follower} vehicles can offload their data to the leader vehicle or directly upload it to the base station (or a combination of the two). In our proposed framework, the leader vehicle is responsible for receiving the data from other vehicles and processing it in order to remove the redundancy (deduplication) before uploading it to the base station. We present a mathematical framework of the considered network and formulate two separate optimization problems for minimizing (i) total time and (ii) total energy consumption by vehicles for uploading their data to the base station. We employ deep reinforcement learning (DRL) tools to obtain solutions in a dynamic vehicular network where network parameters (e.g., vehicle locations and channel coefficients) vary over time. Our results demonstrate that the application of DRL is highly beneficial, and data offloading with deduplication can significantly reduce the time and energy consumption. Furthermore, we present comprehensive numerical results to validate our findings and compare them with alternative approaches to show the benefits of the proposed DRL methods.

Abstract: Purpose: Noise in diffusion-weighted MRI (dMRI) is often spatially correlated due to different acquisition and reconstruction strategies, which is not fully accounted for in current denoising strategies. Thus, we propose a novel model-based denoising method for dMRI that effectively accounts for the different noise characteristics of data. Methods: We propose a denoising strategy that incorporates full noise statistics, including the noise power spectral density (PSD), by leveraging the BM4D algorithm. Furthermore, to exploit redundancy across the diffusion MRI dataset, BM4D is applied to principal components (PC) of diffusion-weighted images (DWI) obtained through principal component analysis (PCA) decomposition of the entire DWI dataset, an approach we refer to as BM4D-PC. Importantly, our method also allows for direct estimation of both the noise map and PSD. We evaluated BM4D-PC against four existing state-of-the-art methods using in-silico and in vivo datasets, including high-resolution human and marmoset acquisitions. Results: Overall, BM4D-PC presented the best results for the metrics PSNR, SSIM and RMSE on the in-silico experiments. The in-vivo studies also showed that BM4D-PC dramatically enhanced the image quality of raw DWIs, outperforming existing denoising methods in terms of noise suppression and detail preservation, leading to improved quality of diffusion metrics. Conclusion: The proposed BM4D-PC method demonstrated state-of-the-art denoising results for dMRI using datasets from various acquisition strategies and image resolutions, potentially supporting future advances in neuroscience research.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: This paper investigates near-field (NF) position and orientation tracking of a multi-antenna mobile station (MS) using an extremely large antenna array (ELAA)-equipped base station (BS) with a limited number of radio frequency (RF) chains. Under this hybrid array architecture, the received uplink pilot signal at the BS is first combined by analog phase shifters, producing a low-dimensional observation before digital processing. Such analog compression provides only partial access to the ELAA measurement, making it essential to design an analog combiner that can preserve pose-relevant signal components despite channel uncertainty and unit-modulus hardware constraints. To address this, we propose a predictive analog combining-assisted extended Kalman filter (PAC-EKF) framework, where the analog combiner can leverage the temporal correlation in the MS pose variation to capture the most informative signal components predictively. We then analyze fundamental performance limits via Bayesian Cramér-Rao bound and Fisher information matrix, explicitly quantifying how the analog combiner, array size, signal-to-noise ratio, and MS pose influence the pose information contained in the uplink observation. Building on these insights, we develop two methods for designing a low-complexity analog combiner. Numerical results show that the proposed predictive analog combining approach significantly improves tracking accuracy, even with fewer RF chains and lower transmit power.

Abstract: As wireless systems evolve toward higher frequencies and extremely large antenna arrays, near-field (NF) propagation becomes increasingly dominant. Unlike far-field (FF) communication, which relies on a planar-wavefront model and is limited to angular-domain beamsteering, NF propagation exhibits spherical wavefronts that enable beamfocusing in both angle and distance, i.e., the polar domain, offering new opportunities for spatial multiple access. This paper develops an analytical stochastic geometry (SG) framework for a multi-user system assisted by polar-domain beamfocusing, which jointly captures NF propagation characteristics and the spatial randomness of user locations. The intrinsic coupling between angle and distance in the NF antenna pattern renders inter-user interference analysis intractable. To address this challenge, we propose a tractable near-field multi-level antenna pattern (NF-MLAP) approximation, which enables computationally efficient expressions and tight upper bounds for key performance metrics, including coverage probability, spectrum efficiency, and area spectrum efficiency. Analytical and simulation results demonstrate that the proposed framework accurately captures performance trends and reveals fundamental trade-offs between hardware configuration (including the number of antennas and radio frequency chains) and system performance (in terms of spatial resource reuse and interference mitigation).

Abstract: The pervasive threat of jamming attacks, particularly from adaptive jammers capable of optimizing their strategies, poses a significant challenge to the security and reliability of wireless communications. This paper addresses this issue by investigating anti-jamming communications empowered by an active reconfigurable intelligent surface. The strategic interaction between the legitimate system and the adaptive jammer is modeled as a Stackelberg game, where the legitimate user, acting as the leader, proactively designs its strategy while anticipating the jammer's optimal response. We prove the existence of the Stackelberg equilibrium and derive it using a backward induction method. Particularly, the jammer's optimal strategy is embedded into the leader's problem, resulting in a bi-level optimization that jointly considers legitimate transmit power, transmit/receive beamformers, and active reflection. We tackle this complex, non-convex problem by using a block coordinate descent framework, wherein subproblems are iteratively solved via convex relaxation and successive convex approximation techniques. Simulation results demonstrate the significant superiority of the proposed active RIS-assisted scheme in enhancing legitimate transmissions and degrading jamming effects compared to baseline schemes across various scenarios. These findings highlight the effectiveness of combining active RIS technology with a strategic game-theoretic framework for anti-jamming communications.

Abstract: The convergence of artificial intelligence (AI) and sixth-generation (6G) wireless technologies is driving an urgent need for large-scale, high-fidelity, and reproducible radio frequency (RF) datasets. Existing resources, such as CKMImageNet, primarily provide preprocessed and image-based channel representations, which conceal the fine-grained physical characteristics of signal propagation that are essential for effective AI modeling. To bridge this gap, we present OpenPathNet, an open-source RF multipath data generator accompanied by a publicly released dataset for AI-driven wireless research. Distinct from prior datasets, OpenPathNet offers disaggregated and physically consistent multipath parameters, including per-path gain, time of arrival (ToA), and spatial angles, derived from high-precision ray tracing simulations constructed on real-world environment maps. By adopting a modular, parameterized pipeline, OpenPathNet enables reproducible generation of multipath data and can be readily extended to new environments and configurations, improving scalability and transparency. The released generator and accompanying dataset provide an extensible testbed that holds promise for advancing studies on channel modeling, beam prediction, environment-aware communication, and integrated sensing in AI-enabled 6G systems. The source code and dataset are publicly available at https://github.com/liu-lz/OpenPathNet.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Deep learning models for Electrocardiogram (ECG) analysis have achieved expert-level performance but remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks. However, applying Universal Adversarial Perturbations (UAP) to ECG signals presents a unique challenge: standard imperceptible noise constraints (e.g., 10 uV) fail to generate effective universal attacks due to the high inter-subject variability of cardiac waveforms. Furthermore, traditional "invisible" attacks are easily dismissed by clinicians as technical artifacts, failing to compromise the human-in-the-loop diagnostic pipeline. In this study, we propose SCAR (Semantic Cardiac Adversarial Representation), a novel UAP framework tailored to bypass the clinical "Human Firewall." Unlike traditional approaches, SCAR integrates spatiotemporal smoothing (W=25, approx. 50ms), spectral consistency (<15 Hz), and anatomical amplitude constraints (<0.2 mV) directly into the gradient optimization manifold.
  Results: We benchmarked SCAR against a rigorous baseline (Standard Universal DeepFool with post-hoc physiological filtering). While the baseline suffers a performance collapse (~16% success rate on transfer tasks), SCAR maintains robust transferability (58.09% on ResNet) and achieves 82.46% success on the source model. Crucially, clinical analysis reveals an emergent targeted behavior: SCAR specifically converges to forging Myocardial Infarction features (90.2% misdiagnosis) by mathematically reconstructing pathological ST-segment elevations. Finally, we demonstrate that SCAR serves a dual purpose: it not only functions as a robust data augmentation strategy for Hybrid Adversarial Training, offering optimal clinical defense, but also provides effective educational samples for training clinicians to recognize low-cost, AI-targeted semantic forgeries.

Abstract: As wireless communication systems continue to grow rapidly, high-performance antennas become increasingly crucial for expanding coverage, improving capacity, and enhancing transmission quality. In light of this, research has focused considerable attention on liquid antennas due to their unique characteristics, which include small size, flexibility, reconfigurability and transparency. Recently, graphene liquid has been explored for numerous applications due to its low cost, high conductivity, flexibility, and ease of processing. Specifically for antenna applications, graphene liquid performs better than conventional liquid metal. This paper presents a graphene-liquid antenna with beam reconfiguration ability for sub-6 GHz communication system. The graphene-liquid movement within the microfluidic channel is taken into consideration by the reconfiguration mechanism. The antenna achieves beam reconfiguration in 360° directions with 6 dBi of gain at 5.5 GHz, featuring a wideband impedance bandwidth of 24%. The antenna main beam is specifically reconfigured into six directions (0°, 45°, 135°, 180°, 225° and 315°) at 5.5 GHz. Additionally, in all six reconfigurable scenarios at 5.5 GHz, the antenna provides a stable reflection coefficient. Therefore, for the next generation of wireless communication systems, this novel design of graphene-liquid-based reconfigurable sub-6 GHz antennas holds promise.

Abstract: We present an algorithm based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) for solving nonlinear matrix decompositions (NMD). Given an input matrix $X \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}$ and a factorization rank $r \ll \min(m, n)$, NMD seeks matrices $W \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times r}$ and $H \in \mathbb{R}^{r \times n}$ such that $X \approx f(WH)$, where $f$ is an element-wise nonlinear function. We evaluate our method on several representative nonlinear models: the rectified linear unit activation $f(x) = \max(0, x)$, suitable for nonnegative sparse data approximation, the component-wise square $f(x) = x^2$, applicable to probabilistic circuit representation, and the MinMax transform $f(x) = \min(b, \max(a, x))$, relevant for recommender systems. The proposed framework flexibly supports diverse loss functions, including least squares, $\ell_1$ norm, and the Kullback-Leibler divergence, and can be readily extended to other nonlinearities and metrics. We illustrate the applicability, efficiency, and adaptability of the approach on real-world datasets, highlighting its potential for a broad range of applications.

Abstract: Research results on Affine Frequency Division Multiplexing (AFDM) reveal that it experiences the same Peak-to-Average Power Ratio (PAPR) problem as conventional Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiplexing (OFDM). On the other side, some references and also our studies demonstrate that AFDM involves an unneeded matrix, which is based on a parameter typically represented by $c_2$, for signalling. Hence, in this paper, an augmented AFDM scheme, referred to as A$^2$FDM, is proposed to mitigate the PAPR problem of AFDM, which is achieved by replacing the $c_2$ matrix in AFDM by a new unitary matrix that performs both sub-block-based Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) and symbol mapping. Two symbol mapping schemes, namely interleaved mapping and localized mapping, are proposed for implementing A$^2$FDM, yielding the Interleaved A$^2$FDM and Localized A$^2$FDM. The input-output relationships of these schemes are derived and the complexity and the effects of system parameters on the performance of A$^2$FDM along with AFDM systems are analyzed. Furthermore, simulation results are provided to demonstrate and compare comprehensively the performance of the considered schemes in conjunction with different system settings and various operational conditions. Our studies and results demonstrate that, while A$^2$FDM is capable of circumventing the PAPR problem faced by AFDM, it is capable of attaining the achievable diversity gain, when AFDM is operated in its undesirable conditions resulting in the loss of the diversity gain available.

Abstract: Accurate estimation of subsurface material properties, such as soil moisture, is critical for wildfire risk assessment and precision agriculture. Ground-penetrating radar (GPR) is a non-destructive geophysical technique widely used to characterize subsurface conditions. Data-driven parameter estimation methods typically require large amounts of labeled training data, which is expensive to obtain from real-world GPR scans under diverse subsurface conditions. A physics-based GPR model using the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method can be employed to generate large synthetic datasets through simulations across varying material parameters, which are then utilized to train data-driven models. A key limitation, however, is that simulated data (source domain) and real-world data (target domain) often follow different distributions, which can cause data-driven models trained on simulations to underperform in real-world scenarios. To address this challenge, this study proposes a novel physics-guided hierarchical domain adaptation framework with deep adversarial learning for robust subsurface material property estimation from GPR signals. The proposed framework is systematically evaluated through the laboratory tests for single- and two-layer materials, as well as the field tests for single- and two-layer materials, and is benchmarked against state-of-the-art methods, including the one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D CNN) and domain adversarial neural network (DANN). The results demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves higher correlation coefficients R and lower Bias between the predicted and measured parameter values, along with smaller standard deviations in the estimations, thereby validating their effectiveness in bridging the domain gap between simulated and real-world radar signals and enabling efficient subsurface material property retrieval.

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel preamble design and detection method for multiuser asynchronous massive MIMO LoRa networks. Unlike existing works, which only consider the preamble detection for a single target end devices (ED), we proposed to simultaneously detect the preambles of multiple EDs that asynchronously transmit their uplink (UL) packets to a multiple-antenna gateway (GW). First we show that the preamble detection in multiuser LoRa networks with the conventional single-chirp preamble suffers from the so-called preamble resemblance effect. This means that the preamble of any single ED can resemble the preambles of all EDs in the network, and make it impossible to determine to which ED a preamble belongs. To address this problem, a novel double-chirp preamble design and a preamble assignment method are proposed, which can mitigate the preamble resemblance effect by making the preamble of each ED unique and recognizable. Next, a maximum-likelihood (ML) based detection scheme for the proposed double-chirp preamble is derived. Finally, since the proposed algorithm requires the calculation of the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) every sampling period, we proposed a low-complexity technique to calculate the DFT recursively to reduce the complexity of our proposed design. Simulation shows that the proposed preamble detection design and detection requires just about 2 dB more power to increase the number of EDs from one to 15 in the Rayleigh fading channel while achieving the same preamble detection error performance.

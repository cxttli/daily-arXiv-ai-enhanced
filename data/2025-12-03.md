Abstract: This paper proposes a hardware-aware intrusion detection system (IDS) for Internet of Things (IoT) and Industrial IoT (IIoT) networks; it targets scenarios where classification is essential for fast, privacy-preserving, and resource-efficient threat detection. The goal is to optimize both tree-based machine learning (ML) models and compact deep neural networks (DNNs) within strict edge-device constraints. This allows for a fair comparison and reveals trade-offs between model families. We apply constrained grid search for tree-based classifiers and hardware-aware neural architecture search (HW-NAS) for 1D convolutional neural networks (1D-CNNs). Evaluation on the Edge-IIoTset benchmark shows that selected models meet tight flash, RAM, and compute limits: LightGBM achieves 95.3% accuracy using 75 KB flash and 1.2 K operations, while the HW-NAS-optimized CNN reaches 97.2% with 190 KB flash and 840 K floating-point operations (FLOPs). We deploy the full pipeline on a Raspberry Pi 3 B Plus, confirming that tree-based models operate within 30 ms and that CNNs remain suitable when accuracy outweighs latency. These results highlight the practicality of hardware-constrained model design for real-time IDS at the edge.

Abstract: 5G and beyond mobile telecommunication networks are increasingly embracing software technologies in their operation and control, similar to what has powered the growth of the cloud. This is most recently seen in the radio access network (RAN). In this new approach, the RAN is increasingly controlled by software applications known as xApps, and opens the door to third party development of xApps bringing diversity to the ecosystem, similar to mobile phone apps. This model aligns closely with the controllers in the ITU-T architecture for autonomous networks, and provides a pathway towards autonomous operation in the RAN. Unfortunately, no marketplace to host or supply xApps currently exists.
  This work describes our experiences in leveraging open-source O-RAN implementations to design and develop an xApp store.

Abstract: We consider a wireless network in which there is a transmitter and a set of users, all of whom want to download a popular file from the transmitter. Using the framework of cooperative game theory, we investigate conditions under which users have incentives to cooperate among themselves to form coalitions for the purpose of receiving the file via multicast from the transmitter. First, using the solution concept of core, we investigate conditions under which it is beneficial for all users to cooperate, i.e., the grand coalition is stable. We provide several sets of sufficient conditions under which the core is non-empty as well as those under which the core is empty. Next, we use the concept of $\mathbb{D}_c$-stability to identify a set of sufficient conditions under which the users in the network form a certain fixed number of coalitions such that all the users within each coalition cooperate among themselves. Our analytical results show how the values of different system parameters, e.g., data rates of different users, transmit and receive power, file size, bandwidth cost, etc., influence stability properties of coalitions, and provide a systematic approach to evaluating cooperation of users for multicast. We also study cooperation among different users using numerical computations. The problem of coalition formation in the context of multicast addressed in this paper is fundamental, and our analysis provides new insights into the feasibility of stable cooperative multicast strategies, contributing to a deeper understanding of cooperation in wireless networks.

Abstract: The Internet-of-Things (IoT) is widely applied for forest monitoring, since the sensor nodes (SNs) in IoT network are low-cost and have computing ability to process the monitoring data. To further improve the performance of forest monitoring, uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) are employed as the data processors to enhance computing capability. However, efficient forest monitoring with limited energy budget and computing resource presents a significant challenge. For this purpose, this paper formulates a multi-objective optimization framework to simultaneously consider three optimization objectives, which are minimizing the maximum computing delay, minimizing the total motion energy consumption, and minimizing the maximum computing resource, corresponding to efficient forest monitoring, energy consumption reduction, and computing resource control, respectively. Due to the hybrid solution space that consists of continuous and discrete solutions, we propose a diffusion model-enhanced improved multi-objective grey wolf optimizer (IMOGWO) to solve the formulated framework. The simulation results show that the proposed IMOGWO outperforms other benchmarks for solving the formulated framework. Specifically, for a small-scale network with $6$ UAVs and $50$ SNs, compared to the suboptimal benchmark, IMOGWO reduces the motion energy consumption and the computing resource by $53.32\%$ and $9.83\%$, respectively, while maintaining computing delay at the same level. Similarly, for a large-scale network with $8$ UAVs and $100$ SNs, IMOGWO achieves reductions of $41.81\%$ in motion energy consumption and $7.93\%$ in computing resource, with the computing delay also remaining comparable.

Abstract: We present ProtO-RU, the first open source, software-defined O-RAN Split-7.2 Radio Unit built using SDRs and commodity CPUs. Unlike proprietary hardware-based commercial O-RUs, ProtO-RU is built on the open-source srsRAN software stack, and it is fully programmable. We demonstrate that ProtO-RU integrates with the srsRAN and OpenAirInterface5G CU/DU stacks, supports both TDD and FDD duplexing modes, and interoperates with commercial 5G UEs. Our evaluation shows that ProtO-RU remains stable under sustained load with multiple UEs and delivers throughput comparable to Split-8 and commercial O-RUs. ProtO-RU opens up new opportunities for RU-level innovations and lowers the barrier of entry for end-to-end O-RAN research.

Abstract: Precise clock synchronization protocols are increasingly used to ensure that all the nodes in a network share the very same time base. They enable several mechanisms aimed at improving determinism at both the application and communication levels, which makes them highly relevant to industrial environments. Reference Broadcast Infrastructure Synchronization (RBIS) is a solution specifically conceived for Wi-Fi that exploits existing beacons and can run on commercial devices. In this paper, an evolution of RBIS is presented, we call DOMINO, whose coverage area is much larger than the single Wi-Fi infrastructure network, potentially including the whole plant. In particular, wireless stations that can see more than one access point at the same time behave as boundary clocks and propagate the reference time across overlapping networks.

Abstract: Wi-Fi is currently considered one of the most promising solutions for interconnecting mobile equipment (e.g., autonomous mobile robots and active exoskeletons) in industrial environments. However, relability requirements imposed by the industrial context, such as ensuring bounded transmission latency, are a major challenge for over-the-air communication. One of the aspects of Wi-Fi technology that greatly affects the probability of a packet reaching its destination is the selection of the appropriate transmission rate. Rate adaptation algorithms are in charge of this operation, but their design and implementation are not regulated by the IEEE 802.11 standard. One of the most popular solutions, available as open source, is Minstrel, which is the default choice for the Linux Kernel. In this paper, Minstrel performance is evaluated for both static and mobility scenarios. Our analysis focuses on metrics of interest for industrial contexts, i.e., latency and packet loss ratio, and serves as a preliminary evaluation for the future development of enhanced rate adaptation algorithms based on centralized digital twins.

Abstract: Persistent rural-urban disparities in broadband connectivity remain a major policy challenge, even in digitally advanced countries. This paper examines how these inequalities manifest in northern Finland and Sweden, where sparse populations, long distances, and seasonal variations in demand create persistent gaps in service quality and reliability. Drawing on survey data (n = 148), in-depth interviews, and spatial analysis, the study explores the lived experience of connectivity in Arctic rural communities and introduces a novel Cellular Coverage Inequality (CCI) Index. The index combines measures of rurality and network performance to quantify spatial disparities that are masked by national coverage statistics. Results reveal that headline indicators overstate inclusiveness, while local users report chronic connectivity gaps affecting work, safety, and access to services. Building on these findings, the paper outlines policy reflections in six areas: shared infrastructure and roaming frameworks, spectrum flexibility for rural operators, performance-based Quality-of-Service monitoring, standardized and transparent reporting, temporal and seasonal capacity management, and digital-skills initiatives. Together, these recommendations highlight the need for multidimensional metrics and governance mechanisms that link technical performance, spatial equity, and user experience. The analysis contributes to ongoing debates on how broadband policy in sparsely populated regions can move beyond nominal coverage targets toward genuine inclusion and reliability.

Abstract: Scalability is a major challenge in non-geostationary orbit (NGSO) satellite networks due to the massive number of ground users sharing the limited sub-6 GHz spectrum. Using K- and higher bands is a promising alternative to increase the accessible bandwidth, but these bands are subject to significant atmospheric attenuation, notably rainfall, which can lead to degraded performance and link outages. We present an integrated sensing and communications (ISAC)-powered framework for resilient and efficient operation of multi-band satellite networks. It is based on distributed mechanisms for atmospheric sensing, cell-to-satellite matching, and resource allocation (RA) in a 5G Non-Terrestrial Network (NTN) wide-area scenario with quasi-Earth fixed cells and a beam hopping mechanism. Results with a multi-layer multi-band constellation with satellites operating in the S- and K-bands demonstrate the benefits of our framework for ISAC-powered multi-band systems, which achieves 73% higher throughput per user when compared to single S- and K-band systems.

Abstract: As modern networks grow in scale and complexity, manual configuration becomes increasingly inefficient and prone to human error. While intent-driven self-configuration using large language models has shown significant promise, such models remain computationally expensive, resource-intensive, and often raise privacy concerns because they typically rely on external cloud infrastructure. This work introduces SLM_netconfig, a fine-tuned small language model framework that uses an agent-based architecture and parameter-efficient adaptation techniques to translate configuration intents expressed as natural language requirements or questions into syntactically and semantically valid network configurations. The system is trained on a domain-specific dataset generated through a pipeline derived from vendor documentation, ensuring strong alignment with real-world configuration practices. Extensive evaluation shows that SLM_netconfig, when using its question-to-configuration model, achieves higher syntactic accuracy and goal accuracy than LLM-NetCFG while substantially reducing translation latency and producing concise, interpretable configurations. These results demonstrate that fine-tuned small language models, as implemented in SLM_netconfig, can deliver efficient, accurate, and privacy-preserving automated configuration generation entirely on-premise, making them a practical and scalable solution for modern autonomous network configuration.

Abstract: A linear code of length $n$ over a finite chain ring $R$ with residue field $\F_q$ is a $R$-submodule of $R^n$. A $R$-linear code is a code over $\F_q$ (not necessarily linear) which is the generalized Gray map image of a linear code over $R$. These codes can be seen as a generalization of the linear codes over $\Z_{p^s}$ with $p$ prime and $s \geq 1$. In this paper, we present the construction of linear simplex codes over $R$ and their corresponding $R$-linear simplex codes of type $α$ and $β$. Moreover, we show the fundamental parameters of these codes, including their minimum Hamming distance, as well as their complete weight distributions. We also study whether these simplex codes are optimal with respect to the Griesmer-type bound.

Abstract: We propose a low-power mobile low earth orbit (LEO) satellite communication architecture, employing double reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) to enhance energy efficiency and signal performance. With a distance between RISs that satisfies the far-field requirement, this architecture positions one small RIS each in the near-field of the satellite's antenna and the user on the ground. Moreover, we develop a path loss model for the double-RIS communication link, considering the near-field and far-field effects. Further, with the help of dual-stage beamforming, the proposed system maximizes the signal power and minimizes power consumption. Simulation results show that the proposed architecture can reduce the power consumption with 40 dB in the uplink, with a small $0.25^2$ $\text{m}^2$ RIS near the user, to communicate in energy-constrained LEO satellite communication circumstances.

Abstract: For certain groups, parabolic subgroups appear as stabilizers of flags of sets or vector spaces. Quotients by these parabolic subgroups represent orbits of flags, and their cardinalities asymptotically reveal entropies (as rates of exponential or superexponential growth). The multiplicative "chain rules" that involve these cardinalities induce, asymptotically, additive analogues for entropies. Many traditional formulas in information theory correspond to quotients of symmetric groups, which are a particular kind of reflection group; in this case, the cardinalities of orbits are given by multinomial coefficients and are asymptotically related to Shannon entropy. One can treat similarly quotients of the general linear groups over a finite field; in this case, the cardinalities of orbits are given by $q$-multinomials and are asymptotically related to the Tsallis 2-entropy. In this contribution, we consider other finite reflection groups as well as the symplectic group as an example of a classical group over a finite field (groups of Lie type). In both cases, the groups are classified by Dynkin diagrams into infinite series of similar groups $A_n$, $B_n$, $C_n$, $D_n$ and a finite number of exceptional ones. The $A_n$ series consists of the symmetric groups (reflection case) and general linear groups (Lie case). Some of the other series, studied here from an information-theoretic perspective for the first time, are linked to new entropic functionals.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new method for constructing a class of non-GRS MDS codes. The lengths of these codes can reach up to $\frac{q+3}{2}$ (for finite fields of odd characteristic) and $\frac{q+4}{2}$ (for even characteristic), respectively. Owing to their special structure, we can use the Cauchy matrix method to obtain the necessary and sufficient conditions for these codes to be MDS codes and non-GRS MDS codes. Additionally, the inequivalence between these codes and twisted GRS codes is analyzed. Furthermore, we analyze the relationships among several existing classes of codes used for constructing non-GRS MDS codes, propose explicit constructions, and discuss the lengths of non-GRS MDS codes based on these constructions. Finally, we design two efficient algorithms to address two main problems in GRS code research, i.e., determining whether an unknown code $C$ is a GRS code from its generator matrix $G$, and recovering the key vectors $\bmα$ and $\bm{v}$ such that $C = \GRS_{n,k}(\bmα, \bm{v})$ if $C$ is indeed a GRS code. A computational complexity comparison of the proposed algorithms ($O(nk+n)$) with that of the Sidelnikov-Shestakov attack (exceeding $O(qk^2n+qk^3)$) shows that our methods offer superior computational efficiency.

Abstract: This paper considers a downlink system where an access point sends the monitored status of multiple sources to multiple users. By jointly accounting for imperfect feedback and constrained transmission rate, which are key limited factors in practical systems, we aim to design scheduling algorithms to optimize the age of information (AoI) over the infinite time horizon. For zero feedback under the generate-at-will traffic, we derive a closed-form lower bound of achievable AoI, which, to the best of our knowledge, reflects the impact of zero feedback for the first time, and propose a policy that achieves this bound in many cases by jointly applying rate splitting and modular arithmetic. For zero feedback under the Bernoulli traffic, we develop a drift-plus-penalty (DPP) policy with a threshold structure based on the theory of Lyapunov optimization and provide a closed-form performance guarantee. Furthermore, we extend the design of this DPP policy to support general imperfect feedback without increasing the online computational complexity. Numerical results verify our theoretical analysis and the AoI advantage of the proposed policies over state-of-the-art policies.

Abstract: Orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) modulation has been proposed to meet the demand for reliable communication in high-mobility scenarios for future wireless networks. However, in multi-user OTFS systems, conventional embedded pilot schemes require independent pilot allocation for each user, leading to linearly increasing pilot overhead. To address these issues, in this paper, we investigate the uplink channel estimation and pilot design for multi-user multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)-OTFS systems. We propose a multi-dimensional decomposition-based channel estimation algorithm. Specifically, the proposed algorithm first estimates the angles of arrivals (AoAs) via subspace decomposition-based method. A spatial projection matrix, constructed from the estimated AOAs, decouples the received signal by propagation path subspace, effectively mitigating inter-path interference. The remaining fractional delay and Doppler can be obtained by a compressed sensing (CS)-based off-grid channel estimation method. Furthermore, to reduce the pilot overhead in multi-user OTFS systems, this paper proposes a novel cyclic shift embedded pilot (CSEP) structure, which can reuse users through cyclic shift-orthogonality of Zadoff-Chu (ZC) sequences. Compared with conventional embedded pilot structures, the CSEP structure can save over 30\% of pilot overhead. Finally, an imporved channel estimation method based on the CSEP structure is proposed. Simulation results demonstrate that it achieves superior performance in channel estimation. Moreover, the proposed CSEP structure and channel estimation algorithm achieve a favorable balance between computational complexity, estimation accuracy, and bit error rate (BER) performance.

Abstract: We introduce the Boltzmann-Shannon Index (BSI), a normalized measure for clustered continuous data that captures the interaction between frequency-based and geometry-based probability distributions. Building on ideas from geometric coarse-graining and information theory, the BSI quantifies how well a partition reflects both the population of each cluster and its effective geometric extent. We illustrate its behavior on synthetic Gaussian mixtures, the Iris benchmark, and a high-imbalance resource-allocation scenario, showing that the index provides a coherent assessment even when traditional metrics give incomplete or misleading signals. Moreover, in resource-allocation settings, we demonstrate that BSI not only detects severe density-geometry inconsistency with high sensitivity, but also offers a smooth, optimization-ready objective that naturally favors allocations balancing demographic weight with each group's effective spread in the outcome space, while providing a smooth, gradient-friendly regularizer that can be easily embedded in modern policy-making and algorithmic governance optimization frameworks.

Abstract: Existing theoretical analyses of satellite mega-constellations often rely on restrictive assumptions, such as short serving times, or lack tractability when evaluating realistic handover strategies. Motivated by these limitations, this paper develops a general analytical framework for accurately characterising the ergodic capacity of low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite networks under arbitrary handover strategies. Specifically, we model the transmission link as shadowed-Rician fading and introduce the persistent satellite channel, wherein the channel process is governed by an i.i.d. renewal process under mild assumptions of uncoordinated handover decisions and knowledge of satellite ephemeris and fading parameters. Within this framework, we derive the ergodic capacity (persistent capacity) of the persistent satellite channel using renewal theory and establish its relation to the non-persistent capacity studied in prior work. To address computational challenges, we present closed-form upper and lower bounds on persistent capacity. The optimal handover problem is formulated as a non-linear fractional program, obtaining an explicit decision rule via a variant of Dinkelbach's algorithm. We further demonstrate that a simpler handover strategy maximising serving capacity closely approximates the optimal strategy, providing practical insights for designing high-throughput LEO satellite communication systems.

Abstract: With the evolution of wireless systems toward large-scale arrays and high-frequency reconfigurable architectures, fluid antenna systems (FAS) operating in the near-field (NF) regime provide new degrees of freedom (DoF) for physical layer security (PLS). This paper proposes an artificial-noise (AN)-aided PLS scheme for NF fluid-antenna multiple-input multiple-output (FA-MIMO) systems, with joint beamforming (BF) and AN design for both compact and large arrays. An alternating-optimization (AO) framework addresses the sparsity-constrained non-convex design by splitting it into a continuous BF/AN joint-design subproblem and a discrete FAS port-selection subproblem. Closed-form fully digital BF/AN solutions are obtained via a generalized spectral water-filling procedure within a block coordinate descent (BCD) surrogate and realized by a hardware-efficient hybrid beamforming (HBF) architecture that embeds AN in the baseband without extra radio-frequency (RF) chains. For FAS port selection, a row-energy based prune--refit rule, aligned with Karush--Kuhn--Tucker (KKT) conditions of a group-sparsity surrogate, enables efficient active-port determination. Simulation results confirm that the proposed design exploits the geometry and position-domain DoF of FAS and significantly improves secrecy performance, particularly for non-extremely-large arrays where NF beam focusing alone is inadequate.

Abstract: Quantum optimization is poised to play a transformative role in the design of next-generation wireless communication systems by addressing key computational and technological challenges. This paper provides an overview of the principles of adiabatic quantum computing, the foundation of quantum optimization, and explores its two primary computational models: quantum annealing and the gate-based quantum approximate optimization algorithm. By highlighting their core features, performance benefits, limitations, and distinctions, we position these methods as promising tools for advancing wireless communication system design. As a case study, we examine the design of passive reconfigurable intelligent surface beamforming with binary phase-shift resolution, supported by experimental results obtained from real-world quantum hardware.

Abstract: Cell-edge users (CEUs) in cellular networks typically suffer from poor channel conditions due to long distances from serving base stations and physical obstructions, resulting in much lower data rates compared to cell-center users (CCUs). This paper proposes an Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV)-assisted cellular network with intelligent power control to address the performance gap between CEUs and CCUs. Unlike conventional approaches that either deploy UAVs for all users or use no UAV assistance, our model uses a distance-based criterion where only users beyond a reference distance receive UAV relay assistance. Each UAV operates as an amplify-and-forward relay, enabling assisted users to receive signals from both the base station and the UAV simultaneously, thereby achieving diversity gain. To optimize transmission power allocation across base stations, we employ a Deep Q-Network (DQN) learning framework that learns power control policies without requiring accurate channel models. Simulation results show that the proposed approach achieves a peak average rate of 2.28 bps/Hz at the optimal reference distance of 400m, which represents a 3.6% improvement compared to networks without UAV assistance and 0.9% improvement compared to networks where all users receive UAV support. The results also reveal that UAV altitude and reference distance are critical factors affecting system performance, with lower altitudes providing better performance.

Abstract: We present a simple $q$-ary family of single-error-correcting, double-error-detecting (SEC--DED) linear codes whose parity checks are tied directly to the base-$p$ ($q=p$ prime) digits of the coordinate index. For blocklength $n=p^r$ the construction uses only $r+1$ parity checks -- \emph{near-Hamming} overhead -- and admits an index-based decoder that runs in a single pass with constant-time location and magnitude recovery from the syndromes. Based on the prototype, we develop two extensions: Code A1, which removes specific redundant trits to achieve higher information rate and support variable-length encoding; and Code A2, which incorporates two group-sum checks together with a 3-wise XOR linear independence condition on index subsets, yielding a ternary distance-4 (SEC--TED) variant. Furthermore, we demonstrate how the framework generalizes via $n$-wise XOR linearly independent sets to construct codes with distance $d = n + 1$, notably recovering the ternary Golay code for $n = 5$ -- showing both structural generality and a serendipitous link to optimal classical codes.
  Our contribution is not optimality but \emph{implementational simplicity} and an \emph{array-friendly} structure: the checks are digitwise and global sums, the mapping from syndromes to error location is explicit, and the SEC--TED upgrade is modular. We position the scheme against classical $q$-ary Hamming and SPC/product-code baselines and provide a small comparison of parity overhead, decoding work, and two-error behavior.

Abstract: We study constrained versions of the Ingleton inequality in the entropic setting and quantify its stability under small violations of conditional independence. Although the classical Ingleton inequality fails for general entropy profiles, it is known to hold under certain exact independence constraints. We focus on the regime where selected conditional mutual information terms are small (but not zero), and the inequality continues to hold up to controlled error terms. A central technical tool is a structural lemma that materializes part of the mutual information between two random variables, implicitly capturing the effect of infinitely many non-Shannon--type inequalities. This leads to conceptually transparent proofs without explicitly invoking such infinite families. Some of our bounds recover, in a unified way, what can also be deduced from the infinite families of inequalities of Matúš (2007) and of Dougherty--Freiling--Zeger (2011), while others appear to be new.

Abstract: While low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes are near capacity-achieving when paired with iterative decoders, these decoders may not output a codeword due to the existence of pseudocodewords. Thus, pseudocodewords have been studied to give insight into the performance of modern decoders including iterative and linear programming decoders. These pseudocodewords are found to be dependent on the parity-check matrix of the code and the particular decoding algorithm used. In this paper, we consider LP decoding, which has been linked to graph cover decoding, providing functions which capture these pseudocodewords. In particular, we analyze the underlying structure of pseudocodewords from quantum stabilizer codes that arise from LP decoding, quasi-cyclic LDPC codes, and spatially-coupled LDPC codes.

Abstract: Accurately recognizing human context from smartphone sensor data remains a significant challenge, especially in sedentary settings where activities such as studying, attending lectures, relaxing, and eating exhibit highly similar inertial patterns. Furthermore, social context plays a critical role in understanding user behavior, yet is often overlooked in mobile sensing research. To address these gaps, we introduce LogMe, a mobile sensing application that passively collects smartphone sensor data (accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer, and rotation vector) and prompts users for hourly self-reports capturing both sedentary activity and social context. Using this dual-label dataset, we propose DySTAN (Dynamic Cross-Stitch with Task Attention Network), a multi-task learning framework that jointly classifies both context dimensions from shared sensor inputs. It integrates task-specific layers with cross-task attention to model subtle distinctions effectively. DySTAN improves sedentary activity macro F1 scores by 21.8% over a single-task CNN-BiLSTM-GRU (CBG) model and by 8.2% over the strongest multi-task baseline, Sluice Network (SN). These results demonstrate the importance of modeling multiple, co-occurring context dimensions to improve the accuracy and robustness of mobile context recognition.

Abstract: In the pursuit of sustainable manufacturing, ultra-short pulse laser micromachining stands out as a promising solution while also offering high-precision and qualitative laser processing. However, unlocking the full potential of ultra-short pulse lasers requires an optimized monitoring system capable of early detection of defective workpieces, regardless of the preprocessing technique employed. While advances in machine learning can help predict process quality features, the complexity of monitoring data necessitates reducing both model size and data dimensionality to enable real-time analysis. To address these challenges, this paper introduces a machine learning framework designed to enhance surface quality assessment across diverse preprocessing techniques. To facilitate real-time laser processing monitoring, our solution aims to optimize the computational requirements of the machine learning model. Experimental results show that the proposed model not only outperforms the generalizability achieved by previous works across diverse preprocessing techniques but also significantly reduces the computational requirements for training. Through these advancements, we aim to establish the baseline for a more sustainable manufacturing process.

Abstract: Complex spatial connectivity patterns, such as interictal suppression and ictal propagation, complicate accurate drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE) seizure detection using stereotactic electroencephalography (SEEG) and traditional machine learning methods. Two critical challenges remain:(1)a low signal-to-noise ratio in functional connectivity estimates, making it difficult to learn seizure-related interactions; and (2)expert labels for spatial pathological connectivity patterns are difficult to obtain, meanwhile lacking the patterns' representation to improve seizure detection. To address these issues, we propose a novel node-graph dual contrastive learning framework, Seizure-NGCLNet, to learn SEEG interictal suppression and ictal propagation patterns for detecting DRE seizures with high precision. First, an adaptive graph augmentation strategy guided by centrality metrics is developed to generate seizure-related brain networks. Second, a dual-contrastive learning approach is integrated, combining global graph-level contrast with local node-graph contrast, to encode both spatial structural and semantic epileptogenic features. Third, the pretrained embeddings are fine-tuned via a top-k localized graph attention network to perform the final classification. Extensive experiments on a large-scale public SEEG dataset from 33 DRE patients demonstrate that Seizure-NGCLNet achieves state-of-the-art performance, with an average accuracy of 95.93%, sensitivity of 96.25%, and specificity of 94.12%. Visualizations confirm that the learned embeddings clearly separate ictal from interictal states, reflecting suppression and propagation patterns that correspond to the clinical mechanisms. These results highlight Seizure-NGCLNet's ability to learn interpretable spatial pathological patterns, enhancing both seizure detection and seizure onset zone localization.

Abstract: The impact of hardware impairments on the spectral efficiency of communication systems is well studied, but their effect on sensing performance remains unexplored. In this paper, we analyze the influence of hardware impairments on integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems in cluttered environments. We derive the sensing signal-to-clutter-plus-noise ratio (SCNR) and show that hardware distortions significantly degrade sensing performance by enhancing clutter-induced noise, which masks target echoes. The isotropic nature of transmit distortion due to multiple stream transmission further complicates clutter suppression. To address this, we propose a distortion- and clutter-aware precoding strategy that minimizes the deviation from the communication-optimized precoder while improving sensing robustness. We also propose an alternative power allocation-based approach that reduces computational complexity. Numerical results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed approaches in overcoming hardware- and clutter-induced limitations, demonstrating significant performance gains over distortion-unaware designs.

Abstract: Wavenumber-division multiplexing (WDM) was introduced as a counterpart of orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing in the spatial-frequency domain for line-of-sight holographic multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. In this paper, we extend WDM to holographic MIMO channels with non-line-of-sight (NLoS) propagation. We show that applying WDM to the NLoS channel yields the corresponding angular-domain representation, which we characterize through the power spectral factor and power spectral density. We further obtain a closed-form characterization for the case of isotropic scattering, recovering Jakes' isotropic model. The analysis is complemented by numerical results evaluating the degrees of freedom and ergodic capacity under both isotropic and non-isotropic scattering.

Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication is widely acknowledged as a foundational technology for next-generation mobile networks. Compared with monostatic sensing, multi-access point (AP) collaborative sensing endows mobile networks with broader, more accurate, and resilient sensing capabilities, which are critical for diverse location-based sectors. This paper focuses on collaborative sensing in multi-AP networks and proposes a Bayesian probability fusion framework for target parameter estimation using orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing waveform. The framework models multi-AP received signals as probability distributions to capture stochastic observations from channel noise and scattering coefficients. Prior information is then incorporated into the joint probability density function to cast the problem as a constrained maximum a posteriori estimation. To address the high-dimensional optimization, we develop a prior-constrained gradient ascent (PCGA) algorithm that decouples correlated parameters and performs efficient gradient updates guided by the target prior. Theoretical analysis covers optimal fusion weights for global signal-to-noise ratio maximization, PCGA convergence, and the Cramer-Rao lower bound of the estimator, with insights applicable to broader fusion schemes. Extensive numerical simulations and real-world experiments with commercial devices show the framework reduces transmission overhead by 90% versus signal fusion and lowers estimation error by 41% relative to parameter fusion. Notably, field tests achieve submeter accuracy with 50% probability in typical coverage of mmWave APs. These improvements highlight a favorable balance between communication efficiency and estimation accuracy for practical multi-AP sensing deployment.

Abstract: This letter addresses the joint air corridor planning and base station (BS) deployment problem for low-altitude integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) networks. In the considered system, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) operate within a structured air corridor composed of connected cubic segments, and multiple BSs need to be selectively deployed at a set of candidate locations to ensure both sensing and communication coverage throughout the corridor. In particular, we leverage the channel knowledge map (CKM) to characterize wireless channels for candidate BS sites prior to deployment, thereby facilitating the offline planning. Under this setup, we minimize the system cost in terms of the weighted sum of the air corridor length and the number of deployed BSs, subject to the constraints on both sensing and communication performance across the corridor. To solve the formulated large-scale nonconvex integer programming problem, we develop a hierarchical coarse-to-fine grid decomposition algorithm. Simulation results demonstrate the benefit of the proposed joint design in reducing the overall deployment cost while ensuring the coverage of the low-altitude ISAC networks.

Abstract: Cell-free massive MIMO (CF-mMIMO) has emerged as a promising technology for next generation wireless systems, combining the benefits of distributed antenna systems (DAS) and traditional MIMO technology. In this work, we present the first extensive channel measurements for CF-mMIMO in the mid-band (FR3, 6-24 GHz), using a virtual widely distributed antenna array comprising 512 elements in the urban Macrocell (UMa) environment. Based on the measurement data, this paper compares the channel capacity of CF-mMIMO and Conventional mMIMO under both line-of-sight (LOS) and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) conditions across a range of signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). We then analyze how channel capacity varies with Rx positions from the perspectives of the full array and of individual subarrays. Finally, we conclude that the 64-element array configuration yields the greatest advantage in channel capacity for CF-mMIMO in the measurement environment considered, with gains of 14.02\% under LOS and 24.61\% under NLOS conditions. This in-depth analysis of channel capacity in the FR3 band provides critical insights for optimizing CF-mMIMO systems in next generation wireless networks.

Abstract: Accurate beam prediction is essential for maintaining reliable links and high spectral efficiency in dynamic low-altitude wireless networks. However, existing approaches often fail to capture the deep correlations across heterogeneous sensing modalities, limiting their adaptability in complex three-dimensional environments. To overcome these challenges, we propose a multi-modal predictive beamforming method based on a cross-attention fusion mechanism that jointly leverages visual and structured sensor data. The proposed model utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to learn multi-scale spatial feature hierarchies from visual images and a Transformer encoder to capture cross-dimensional dependencies within sensor data. Then, a cross-attention fusion module is introduced to integrate complementary information between the two modalities, generating a unified and discriminative representation for accurate beam prediction. Through experimental evaluations conducted on a real-world dataset, our method reaches 79.7% Top-1 accuracy and 99.3% Top-3 accuracy, surpassing the 3D ResNet-Transformer baseline by 4.4%-23.2% across Top-1 to Top-5 metrics. These results verify that multi-modal cross-attention fusion is effective for intelligent beam selection in dynamic low-altitude wireless networks.

Abstract: In multi-user multiple-input multiple-output (MU-MIMO) systems, the non-linear behavior of the power amplifiers (PAs) may cause degradation of the linear precoding schemes dealing with interference between user equipments (UEs), e.g., the zero-forcing (ZF) precoder. One way to minimize this effect is to use digital-pre-distortion (DPD) modules to linearize the PAs. However, using perfect DPD modules is costly and it may incur significant power consumption. As an alternative, we consider the problem of characterizing non-linearity-aware ZF (NLA-ZF) precoding schemes, hereby defined as linear precoders that achieve perfect interference cancellation in the presence of PA non-linearity by exploiting knowledge of this non-linear response. We provide initial iterative solutions that allow achieving NLA-ZF (up to adjustable tolerance) in a two-UE downlink MU-MIMO scenario where the base station (BS) has an even number of antennas, and each antenna is connected to a PA exhibiting third-order memory-less non-linear behavior. The proposed approach allows for performance gains in scenarios with significant residual interference.

Abstract: Massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) offers substantial spectral-efficiency gains, but scaling to very large antenna arrays with conventional all-digital and hybrid beamforming architectures quickly results in excessively high costs and power consumption. Low-cost, switch-based architectures have recently emerged as a potential alternative. However, prior studies rely on simplified models that ignore (among others) antenna coupling, radiation patterns, and matching losses, resulting in inaccurate performance predictions. In this paper, we use a physically consistent electromagnetic modeling framework to analyze an ultra-dense patch-antenna array architecture that performs joint beamforming and matching using networks of inexpensive RF switches. Our results demonstrate that simple, switch-based beamforming architectures can approach the antenna-gain of all-digital solutions at significantly lower cost and complexity.

Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have advanced the data-driven solution of differential equations (DEs) in dynamic physical systems, yet challenges remain in explainability, scalability, and architectural complexity. This paper presents a Generalizable Physics-Informed Fourier Neural Network (G-PIFNN) framework that enhances PINN architectures for efficient and interpretable electrical circuit analysis. The proposed G-PIFNN introduces three key advancements: (1) improved performance and interpretability via a physics activation function (PAF) and a lightweight Physics-Informed Fourier Neural Network (PIFNN) architecture; (2) automated, bond graph (BG) based formulation of physics-informed loss functions for systematic differential equation generation; and (3) integration of intra-circuit and cross-circuit class transfer learning (TL) strategies, enabling unsupervised fine-tuning for rapid adaptation to varying circuit topologies. Numerical simulations demonstrate that G-PIFNN achieves significantly better predictive performance and generalization across diverse circuit classes, while significantly reducing the number of trainable parameters compared to standard PINNs.

Abstract: The ability to construct Channel Knowledge Map (CKM) with high precision is essential for environment awareness in 6G wireless systems. However, most existing CKM construction methods formulate the task as an image super-resolution or generation problem, thereby employing models originally developed for computer vision. As a result, the generated CKMs often fail to capture the underlying physical characteristics of wireless propagation. In this paper, we focus on the construction of CKM for large-scale fading scenarios and design three physics-based constraint terms to characterize the spatial distribution patterns of large-scale fading. By integrating these physical constraints with a state-of-the-art diffusion model that possesses superior generative capability, a physics-inspired diffusion model for CKM construction is proposed. Following this motivation, we derive the loss function of the diffusion model augmented with physics-based constraint terms and further design the training and generation framework for the proposed physics-inspired CKM generation diffusion model. Extensive experiments show that our approach outperforms all existing methods in terms of construction accuracy. Moreover, the proposed model provides a unified and effective framework with strong potential for generating diverse, accurate, and physically consistent CKM.

Abstract: Accelerated brain aging has been consistently reported in patients with schizophrenia. Over the past decade, these findings have been replicated using the Brain Age paradigm, which applies machine learning techniques to estimate brain age from neuroimaging data. This approach yields a single index, the Brain Age Gap, defined as the difference between predicted and chronological age. Nevertheless, both the progressive nature of this phenomenon and the potential role of antipsychotic medication remain unclear. To investigate its progression, we compared the Brain Age Gap between individuals experiencing a first episode of psychosis and healthy controls using ANCOVA, adjusting for age, sex, body mass index, and estimated total intracranial volume. To enhance the robustness of our findings, we employed two distinct models: a transformer-inspired model based on harmonized volumetric brain features extracted with FastSurfer, and a previously trained deep learning model. To assess the potential effect of medication, we further compared bipolar patients who received antipsychotic treatment with those who did not. Mann-Whitney U test consistently showed that medicated bipolar patients did not exhibit a significantly larger Brain Age Gap. Both models converge on the conclusion that accelerated brain aging is unlikely to be explained by antipsychotic medication alone. Longitudinal studies are therefore required to clarify the temporal dynamics of brain aging in schizophrenia.

Abstract: Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imaging plays a critical role in all-weather, day-and-night remote sensing, yet reconstruction is often challenged by noise, undersampling, and complex scattering scenarios. Conventional methods, including matched filtering and sparsity-based compressed sensing, are limited in capturing intricate scene structures and frequently suffer from artifacts, elevated sidelobes, and loss of fine details. Recent diffusion models have demonstrated superior capability in representing high-order priors; however, existing diffusion-based SAR methods still yield degraded reconstructions due to oversimplified likelihood approximations in guided sampling. In this work, we propose a diffusion-driven split Gibbs sampling framework for SAR reconstruction, rigorously integrating measurement fidelity with learned diffusion priors. By alternately performing likelihood- and prior-driven updates via proximal sampling, this method ensures progressive convergence toward the true posterior while fully leveraging the expressive power of diffusion priors. Extensive experiments on simulated and Sentinel-1A datasets demonstrate substantial performance improvements: over 7 dB average PSNR gain in simulations, along with significant sidelobe suppression (MPLSR +2.96 dB, MISLR +11.5 dB) with respect to the best baseline result. On real-world Sentinel-1A data, the method achieves an average PSNR gain of 1.6 dB while effectively reducing artifacts and preserving scene details, including ridges, edges, and fine textures. These results underscore the potential of the adapted framework as a robust and generalizable solution for high-fidelity SAR imaging across diverse sensing scenarios.

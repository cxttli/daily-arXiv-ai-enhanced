Due to the incorporation of the discrete affine Fourier transform (DAFT) and despreading/mapping, an interesting and counter-intuitive cancellation of the unwanted combination of the channel induced interference with the orthogonality approximation error is seen in the filtered TD, a process which does not occur in the affine domain. The direct impact on bit error rate (BER) provides a thorough validation of the proposed analysis and explains the substantial gains in performance of the filtered TD detection scheme as opposed to its affine domain equivalent"}

Existing analyses often rely on Gaussian approximations and overlook fading effects, which limits their accuracy. This paper presents an accurate analytical framework for optimal bit detection in TNC systems under Rician fading. Using chi-squared statistics, we derive the optimal maximum-likelihood detection threshold and an expression for the bit error probability (BEP) via Gauss-Laguerre quadrature. The proposed model eliminates approximation errors and accurately characterizes performance for finite sample sizes. Monte Carlo simulations confirm the analytical results and demonstrate significant improvements in BEP compared with suboptimal Gaussian-based detection. Furthermore, the influence of key parameters, sample size, resistance ratio, and Rician K-factor, is quantified. The proposed framework provides a solid foundation for designing energy-efficient TNC receivers in future B5G/6G and large-scale IoT systems."}

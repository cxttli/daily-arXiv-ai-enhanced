Abstract: Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) is critical for efficient
spectrum and hardware utilization in future wireless networks like 6G. However,
existing channel models lack comprehensive characterization of ISAC-specific
dynamics, particularly the relationship between mono-static (co-located Tx/Rx)
and bi-static (separated Tx/Rx) sensing configurations. Empirical measurements
in dynamic urban microcell (UMi) environments using a 79-GHz FMCW channel
sounder help bridge this gap. Two key findings are demonstrated: (1)
mono-static and bi-static channels exhibit consistently low instantaneous
correlation due to divergent propagation geometries; (2) despite low
instantaneous correlation, both channels share unified temporal consistency,
evolving predictably under environmental kinematics. These insights, validated
across seven real-world scenarios with moving targets/transceivers, inform
robust ISAC system design and future standardization.

Abstract: Intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRSs) have become a vital technology for
improving the spectrum and energy efficiency of forthcoming wireless networks.
Nevertheless, practical implementation is obstructed by the excessive overhead
associated with the frequent transmission of phase shift information (PSI) over
bandwidth-constrained control lines. Current deep learning-based compression
methods mitigate this problem but are constrained by elevated decoder
complexity, inadequate flexibility to dynamic channels, and static compression
ratios. This research presents a prompt-conditioned PSI compression system that
integrates prompt learning inspired by large models into the PSI compression
process to address these difficulties. A hybrid prompt technique that
integrates soft prompt concatenation with feature-wise linear modulation (FiLM)
facilitates adaptive encoding across diverse signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs),
fading kinds, and compression ratios. Furthermore, a variable rate technique
incorporates the compression ratio into the prompt embeddings through latent
masking, enabling a singular model to adeptly balance reconstruction accuracy.
Additionally, a lightweight depthwise convolutional gating (DWCG) decoder
facilitates precise feature reconstruction with minimal complexity.
Comprehensive simulations indicate that the proposed framework significantly
reduces NMSE compared to traditional autoencoder baselines, while ensuring
robustness across various channel circumstances and accommodating variable
compression ratios within a single model. These findings underscore the
framework's promise as a scalable and efficient solution for real-time IRS
control in next-generation wireless networks.

Abstract: This paper introduces an approach to multi-stream quickest change detection
and fault isolation for unnormalized and score-based statistical models.
Traditional optimal algorithms in the quickest change detection literature
require explicit pre-change and post-change distributions to calculate the
likelihood ratio of the observations, which can be computationally expensive
for higher-dimensional data and sometimes even infeasible for complex machine
learning models. To address these challenges, we propose the min-SCUSUM method,
a Hyvarinen score-based algorithm that computes the difference of score
functions in place of log-likelihood ratios. We provide a delay and false alarm
analysis of the proposed algorithm, showing that its asymptotic performance
depends on the Fisher divergence between the pre- and post-change
distributions. Furthermore, we establish an upper bound on the probability of
fault misidentification in distinguishing the affected stream from the
unaffected ones.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Low earth orbit (LEO) satellite-assisted integrated sensing and
communications (ISAC) systems have been extensively studied to achieve
ubiquitous connectivity. However, the severe signal attenuation and limited
transmit power at LEO satellites can degrade ISAC performance. To address this
issue, this paper investigated movable antenna (MA)-assisted LEO ISAC systems.
We derive the communication signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) and
the sensing squared position error bound (SPEB) for evaluating the ISAC
performance. Then, we jointly optimize the transmit beamforming and the MA
positions to minimize the SPEB under the SINR constraints, total transmit power
constraint, and several inherent physical constraints of the MA array. We first
simplify the complex problem using the semidefinite relaxation (SDR). Then, we
present a novel alternating optimization (AO)-based algorithm to decouple the
original problem into two subproblems, consequently convexified and solved.
Simulations demonstrate the convergence and effectiveness of the proposed
algorithm. Better trade-off between communication and sensing performance, and
at least 25% gain in sensing performance are achieved, compared to the
benchmarks.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: It is well established that the performance of reconfigurable intelligent
surface (RIS)-assisted systems critically depends on the optimal placement of
the RIS. Previous works consider either simple coverage maximization or
simultaneous optimization of the placement of the RIS along with the
beamforming and reflection coefficients, most of which assume that the location
of the RIS, base station (BS), and users are known. However, in practice, only
the spatial variation of user density and obstacle configuration are likely to
be known prior to deployment of the system. Thus, we formulate a non-convex
problem that optimizes the position of the RIS over the expected minimum
signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) of the system with user
randomness, assuming that the system employs joint beamforming after
deployment. To solve this problem, we propose a recursive coarse-to-fine
methodology that constructs a set of candidate locations for RIS placement
based on the obstacle configuration and evaluates them over multiple
instantiations from the user distribution. The search is recursively refined
within the optimal region identified in each stage to determine the final
optimal region for RIS deployment. Numerical results are presented to
corroborate our findings.

Abstract: The massive scale of Wireless Foundation Models (FMs) hinders their real-time
deployment on edge devices. This letter moves beyond standard knowledge
distillation by introducing a novel Multi-Component Adaptive Knowledge
Distillation (MCAKD) framework. Key innovations include a Cross-Attention-Based
Knowledge Selection (CA-KS) module that selectively identifies critical
features from the teacher model, and an Autonomous Learning-Passive Learning
(AL-PL) strategy that balances knowledge transfer with independent learning to
achieve high training efficiency at a manageable computational cost. When
applied to the WiFo FM, the distilled Tiny-WiFo model, with only 5.5M
parameters, achieves a 1.6 ms inference time on edge hardware while retaining
over 98% of WiFo's performance and its crucial zero-shot generalization
capability, making real-time FM deployment viable.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: This paper investigates the ambiguity function (AF) of the emerging affine
frequency division multiplexing (AFDM) waveform for Integrated Sensing and
Communication (ISAC) signaling under a pulse shaping regime. Specifically, we
first derive the closed-form expression of the average squared discrete period
AF (DPAF) for AFDM waveform without pulse shaping, revealing that the AF
depends on the parameter $c_1$ and the kurtosis of random communication data,
while being independent of the parameter $c_2$. As a step further, we conduct a
comprehensive analysis on the AFs of various waveforms, including AFDM,
orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) and orthogonal chirp-division
multiplexing (OCDM). Our results indicate that all three waveforms exhibit the
same number of regular depressions in the sidelobes of their AFs, which incurs
performance loss for detecting and estimating weak targets. However, the AFDM
waveform can flexibly control the positions of depressions by adjusting the
parameter $c_1$, which motivates a novel design approach of the AFDM parameters
to mitigate the adverse impact of depressions of the strong target on the weak
target. Furthermore, a closed-form expression of the average squared DPAF for
pulse-shaped random AFDM waveform is derived, which demonstrates that the pulse
shaping filter generates the shaped mainlobe along the delay axis and the rapid
roll-off sidelobes along the Doppler axis. Numerical results verify the
effectiveness of our theoretical analysis and proposed design methodology for
the AFDM modulation.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Human action recognition (HAR) with multi-modal inputs (RGB-D, skeleton,
point cloud) can achieve high accuracy but typically relies on large labeled
datasets and degrades sharply when sensors fail or are noisy. We present Robust
Cross-Modal Contrastive Learning (RCMCL), a self-supervised framework that
learns modality-invariant representations and remains reliable under modality
dropout and corruption. RCMCL jointly optimizes (i) a cross-modal contrastive
objective that aligns heterogeneous streams, (ii) an intra-modal
self-distillation objective that improves view-invariance and reduces
redundancy, and (iii) a degradation simulation objective that explicitly trains
models to recover from masked or corrupted inputs. At inference, an Adaptive
Modality Gating (AMG) network assigns data-driven reliability weights to each
modality for robust fusion. On NTU RGB+D 120 (CS/CV) and UWA3D-II, RCMCL
attains state-of-the-art accuracy in standard settings and exhibits markedly
better robustness: under severe dual-modality dropout it shows only an 11.5%
degradation, significantly outperforming strong supervised fusion baselines.
These results indicate that self-supervised cross-modal alignment, coupled with
explicit degradation modeling and adaptive fusion, is key to deployable
multi-modal HAR.

Abstract: In this study, we examine the potential of high-resolution forest mapping
using L-band interferometric time series datasets and deep learning modeling.
Our SAR data are represented by a time series of nine ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 dual-pol
SAR images acquired at near-zero spatial baseline over a study site in
Asturias, Northern Spain. Reference data are collected using airborne laser
scanning. We examine the performance of several candidate deep learning models
from UNet-family with various combinations of input polarimetric and
interferometric features. In addition to basic Vanilla UNet, attention
reinforced UNet model with squeeze-excitation blocks (SeU-Net) and advanced
UNet model with nested structure and skip pathways are used. Studied features
include dual pol interferometric observables additionally incorporating
model-based derived measures. Results show that adding model-based inverted
InSAR features or InSAR coherence layers improves retrieval accuracy compared
to using backscatter intensity only. Use of attention mechanisms and nested
connection fusion provides better predictions than using Vanilla UNet or
traditional machine learning methods. Forest height retrieval accuracies range
between 3.1-3.8 m (R2 = 0.45--0.55) at 20 m resolution when only intensity data
are used, and improve to less than 2.8 m when both intensity and
interferometric coherence features are included. At 40 m and 60 m resolution,
retrieval performance further improves, primarily due to higher SNR in both the
intensity and interferometric layers. When using intensity at 60 m resolution,
best achieved RMSE is 2.2 m, while when using all suitable input features the
achieved error is 1.95 m. We recommend this hybrid approach for L-band SAR
retrievals also suitable for NISAR and future ROSE-L missions.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS) have been recognized as a promising
technology to enhance both communication and sensing performance in integrated
sensing and communication (ISAC) systems for future 6G networks. However,
existing RIS optimization methods for improving ISAC performance are mainly
based on semidefinite relaxation (SDR) or iterative algorithms. The former
suffers from high computational complexity and limited scalability, especially
when the number of RIS elements becomes large, while the latter yields
suboptimal solutions whose performance depends on initialization. In this work,
we introduce a lightweight RIS phase design framework that provides a
closed-form solution and explicitly accounts for the trade-off between
communication and sensing, as well as proportional beam gain distribution
toward multiple sensing targets. The key idea is to partition the RIS
configuration into two parts: the first part is designed to maximize the
communication performance, while the second introduces small perturbations to
generate multiple beams for multi-target sensing. Simulation results validate
the effectiveness of the proposed approach and demonstrate that it achieves
performance comparable to SDR but with significantly lower computational
complexity.

Abstract: This paper presents a switch-type attenuator working from 20 to 100 GHz. The
attenuator adopts a capacitive compensation technique to reduce phase error.
The small resistors in this work are implemented with metal lines to reduce the
intrinsic parasitic ca?pacitance, which helps minimize the amplitude and phase
errors over a wide frequency range. Moreover, the utilization of metal lines
also reduces the chip area. In addition, a continuous tuning attenuation unit
is employed to improve the overall attenuation accuracy of the attenuator. The
passive attenuator is designed and fabricated in a standard 65nm CMOS. The
measurement results reveal a relative attenuation range of 7.5 dB with a
continuous tuning step within 20-100 GHz. The insertion loss is 1.6-3.8 dB
within the operation band, while the return losses of all states are better
than 11.5 dB. The RMS amplitude and phase errors are below 0.15 dB and
1.6{\deg}, respectively.

Abstract: Wideband and low-latency requirements in sixth-generation (6G) networks
demand detectors that approach maximum-likelihood (ML) performance without
incurring exponential complexity. This work develops a hybrid quantum-classical
detection framework for reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted
single-carrier (SC) frequency-domain equalization (FDE) over
frequency-selective channels. The ML detection objective is reformulated as a
quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) problem and solved via
Grover adaptive search (GAS). To accelerate convergence, we introduce a
frequency-domain MMSE threshold that exploits the circulant structure of SC-FDE
channels, yielding low-complexity initialization. The framework is evaluated
across varying channel lengths and RIS sizes, confirming robustness and
scalability. In addition, GAS requirements are quantified through register
widths and gate counts, and its query complexity is analyzed to characterize
the algorithm's cost for block transmission in frequency-selective channels.
Quantum circuit simulations are conducted in Qiskit under both ideal and noisy
conditions. In the ideal case, the detector achieves near-optimal performance
while benefiting from Grover's quadratic speedup, reducing the search cost from
from O(M^N) exhaustive evaluations to O(SQRT(M^N)) oracle queries. Under noise,
the shallow depth of the GAS circuits, aided by MMSE initialization, makes
depolarizing errors negligible, while readout errors introduce moderate
degradation yet still preserve performance close to the MMSE baseline. These
results establish the feasibility of quantum-enhanced detection for
RIS-assisted broadband communications, highlighting both algorithmic
scalability and practical robustness for 6G networks.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The rise of distributed AI and large-scale applications has impacted the
communication operations of data-center and Supercomputer interconnection
networks, leading to dramatic incast or in-network congestion scenarios and
challenging existing congestion control mechanisms, such as injection
throttling (e.g., DCQCN) or congestion isolation (CI). While DCQCN provides a
scalable traffic rate adjustment for congesting flows at end nodes (which is
slow) and CI effectively isolates these flows in special network resources
(which requires extra logic in the switches), their combined use, although it
diminishes their particular drawbacks, leads to false congestion scenarios
identification and signaling, excessive throttling, and inefficient network
resource utilization. In this paper, we propose a new CI mechanism, called
Improved Congestion Isolation (ICI), which efficiently combines CI and DCQCN so
that the information of the isolated congesting flows is used to guide the ECN
marking performed by DCQCN in a way that victim flows do not end up being
marked. This coordination reduces false-positive congestion detection,
suppresses unnecessary closed-loop feedback (i.e., wrong congestion
notifications), and improves responsiveness to communication microbursts.
Evaluated under diverse traffic patterns, including incast and Data-center
workloads, ICI reduces the number of generated BECNs by up to 32x and improves
tail latency by up to 31%, while maintaining high throughput and scalability.

Abstract: This paper exploits the dynamic features of wireless propagation environments
as the basis for a new multiple access technique, termed environment division
multiple access (EDMA). In particular, with the proposed
pinching-antenna-assisted EDMA, the multi-user propagation environment is
intelligently reconfigured to improve signal strength at intended receivers and
simultaneously suppress multiple-access interference, without requiring complex
signal processing, e.g., precoding, beamforming, or multi-user detection. The
key to creating a favorable propagation environment is to utilize the
capability of pinching antennas to reconfigure line-of-sight (LoS) links, e.g.,
pinching antennas are placed at specific locations, such that interference
links are blocked on purpose. Based on a straightforward choice of
pinching-antenna locations, the ergodic sum-rate gain of EDMA over conventional
multiple access and the probability that EDMA achieves a larger instantaneous
sum rate than the considered benchmarking scheme are derived in closed form.
The obtained analytical results demonstrate the significant potential of EDMA
for supporting multi-user communications. Furthermore, pinching antenna
location optimization is also investigated, since the locations of pinching
antennas are critical for reconfiguring LoS links and large-scale path losses.
Two low-complexity algorithms are developed for uplink and downlink
transmission, respectively, and simulation results are provided to show their
optimality in comparison to exhaustive searches.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: A canonical step in quantifying a system is to measure its entropy. Shannon
entropy and other traditional entropy measures capture only the information
encoded in the frequencies of a system's elements. Recently, Leinster, Cobbold,
and Reeve (LCR) introduced a method that also captures the rich information
encoded in the similarities and differences among elements, yielding
similarity-sensitive entropy. More recently, the Vendi score (VS) was
introduced as an alternative, raising the question of how LCR and VS compare,
and which is preferable. Here we address these questions conceptually,
analytically, and experimentally, using 53 machine-learning datasets. We show
that LCR and VS can differ by orders of magnitude and can capture complementary
information about a system, except in limiting cases. We demonstrate that both
LCR and VS depend on how similarities are scaled and introduce the concept of
``half distance'' to parameterize this dependence. We prove that VS provides an
upper bound on LCR for several values of the R\'enyi-Hill order parameter and
conjecture that this bound holds for all values. We conclude that VS is
preferable only when interpreting elements as linear combinations of a more
fundamental set of ``ur-elements'' or when the system or dataset possesses a
quantum-mechanical character. In the broader circumstance where one seeks
simply to capture the rich information encoded by similarity, LCR is favored;
nevertheless, for certain half-distances the two methods can complement each
other.

Abstract: Given a channel with length-$n$ inputs and outputs over the alphabet
$\{0,1,\ldots,q-1\}$, and of which a fraction $\varrho \in (0,1-1/q)$ of
symbols can be arbitrarily corrupted by an adversary, a fundamental problem is
that of communicating at rates close to the information-theoretically optimal
values, while ensuring the receiver can infer that the transmitter's message is
from a ``small" set. While the existence of such codes is known, and
constructions with computationally tractable encoding/decoding procedures are
known for large $q$, we provide the first schemes that attain this performance
for any $q \geq 2$, as long as low-rate feedback (asymptotically negligible
relative to the number of transmissions) from the receiver to the transmitter
is available. For any sufficiently small $\varepsilon > 0$ and $\varrho \in
(1-1/q-\Theta(\sqrt{\varepsilon})$ our minimal feedback scheme has the
following parameters: Rate $1-H_q(\varrho) - \varepsilon$ (i.e.,
$\varepsilon$-close to information-theoretically optimal -- here $H_q(\varrho)$
is the $q$-ary entropy function), list-size
$\exp(\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-3/2}\log^2(1/\varepsilon))$, computational
complexity of encoding/decoding
$n^{\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-1}\log(1/\varepsilon))}$, storage complexity
$\mathcal{O}(n^{\eta+1}\log n)$ for a code design parameter $\eta>1$ that
trades off storage complexity with the probability of error. The error
probability is $\mathcal{O}(n^{-\eta})$, and the (vanishing) feedback rate is
$\mathcal{O}(1/ \log n)$.

Motivation: 随着零知识系统的最新发展，对伽罗瓦环上码的邻近性差距研究需求日益增长。之前有限域上RS码的列表解码已有较好结果，但伽罗瓦环上缺乏相应研究，这可能阻碍基于环的算术电路零知识证明系统的发展。

Method: 首先将Guruswami-Sudan的列表解码算法扩展到伽罗瓦环上的Reed-Solomon码，然后研究折叠Reed-Solomon码的列表解码性能，最后通过扩展Srivastava(2025)的最新工作来改进列表大小。

Result: 证明了速率为r的RS码可以在伽罗瓦环上实现半径为1-√r的列表解码；折叠Reed-Solomon码的列表解码半径可以达到Singleton界；将折叠Reed-Solomon码的列表大小改进为O(1/ε²)。

Conclusion: 这项研究为基于环的算术电路零知识证明系统提供了理论基础，扩展了列表解码理论在更一般代数结构上的应用，为密码学和编码理论的交叉领域做出了重要贡献。

Abstract: List decoding of codes can be seen as the generalization of unique decoding
of codes While list decoding over finite fields has been extensively studied,
extending these results to more general algebraic structures such as Galois
rings remains an important challenge. Due to recent progress in zero knowledge
systems, there is a growing demand to investigate the proximity gap of codes
over Galois rings in Yizhou Yao and coauthors(2025), Alexander Golovne and
coauthors(2023), Yuanju Wei and coauthors(2025). The proximity gap is closely
related to the decoding capability of codes. It was shown in Eli Ben-Sasson and
coauthors(2020) that the proximity gap for RS codes over finite field can be
improved to $1-\sqrt{r}$ if one consider list decoding instead of unique
decoding. However, we know very little about RS codes over Galois ring which
might hinder the development of zero knowledge proof system for ring-based
arithmetic circuit. In this work, we first extend the list decoding procedure
of Guruswami and Sudan to Reed-Solomon codes over Galois rings, which shows
that RS codes with rate $r$ can be list decoded up to radius $1-\sqrt{r}$.
Then, we investigate the list decoding of folded Reed-Solomon codes over Galois
rings. We show that the list decoding radius of folded Reed-Solomon codes can
reach the Singlton bound as its counterpart over finite field. Finally, we
improve the list size of our folded Reed-Solomon code to
$O(\frac{1}{\varepsilon^2})$ by extending recent work in Shashank
Srivastava(2025) to Galois Rings.

Abstract: Affine Frequency Division Multiplexing (AFDM) has been proposed as an
effective waveform for achieving the full diversity of doubly-dispersive
(delay-Doppler) channels. While this property is closely related to range and
velocity estimation in sensing, this article focuses on other AFDM features
that are particularly relevant for addressing two challenges in integrated
sensing and communication (ISAC) systems: (1) maintaining receiver complexity
and energy consumption at acceptable levels while supporting the large
bandwidths required for high delay/range resolution, and (2) mitigating
interference in multiradar environments. In monostatic sensing, where direct
transmitter-receiver leakage is a major impairment, we show that AFDM-based
ISAC receivers can address the first challenge through their compatibility with
low-complexity self-interference cancellation (SIC) schemes and reduced
sampling rates via analog dechirping. In bistatic sensing, where such analog
solutions may not be feasible, we demonstrate that AFDM supports sub-Nyquist
sampling without requiring hardware modifications while preserving delay
resolution. Finally, we show that the second challenge can be addressed by
leveraging the resource-assignment flexibility of the discrete affine Fourier
transform (DAFT) underlying the AFDM waveform.

Abstract: We consider a time-slotted job-assignment system with a central server, N
users and a machine which changes its state according to a Markov chain (hence
called a Markov machine). The users submit their jobs to the central server
according to a stochastic job arrival process. For each user, the server has a
dedicated job queue. Upon receiving a job from a user, the server stores that
job in the corresponding queue. When the machine is not working on a job
assigned by the server, the machine can be either in internally busy or in free
state, and the dynamics of these states follow a binary symmetric Markov chain.
Upon sampling the state information of the machine, if the server identifies
that the machine is in the free state, it schedules a user and submits a job to
the machine from the job queue of the scheduled user. To maximize the number of
jobs completed per unit time, we introduce a new metric, referred to as the age
of job completion. To minimize the age of job completion and the sampling cost,
we propose two policies and numerically evaluate their performance. For both of
these policies, we find sufficient conditions under which the job queues will
remain stable.

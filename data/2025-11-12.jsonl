We begin by formulating a Mixed-Integer Nonlinear Programming (MINLP) model that jointly considers throughput maximization and delay minimization between access points and IoT nodes under energy and link availability constraints. However, given the intractability of solving such NP-hard problems at scale and the impractical assumption of full channel observability, we propose the Dual-Graph Embedding with Transformer (DGET) framework, a supervised multi-task learning architecture combining a two-stage Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with a Transformer-based encoder. The first stage employs a transductive GNN that encodes the known graph topology and initial node and link states. The second stage introduces an inductive GNN for temporal refinement, which learns to generalize these embeddings to the evolved states of the same network, capturing changes in energy and queue dynamics over time, by aligning them with ground-truth scheduling decisions through a consistency loss. These enriched embeddings are then processed by a classifier for the communication links with a Transformer encoder that captures cross-link dependencies through multi-head self-attention via classification loss. Simulation results show that hybrid RF-OWC networks outperform standalone RF systems by handling higher traffic loads more efficiently and reducing the Age of Information (AoI) by up to 20%, all while maintaining comparable energy consumption. The proposed DGET framework, compared to traditional optimization-based methods, achieves near-optimal scheduling with over 90% classification accuracy, reduces computational complexity, and demonstrates higher robustness under partial channel observability."}

Ensuring their correctness before deployment is thus critical for reliability. While prior verification frameworks can efficiently detect bugs for programs running on a single switch, they overlook the common interactive behaviors in distributed settings, thereby missing related bugs that can cause state inconsistencies and system failures. This paper presents Procurator, a verification framework that efficiently captures interactive behaviors in distributed in-network programs. Procurator introduces a formal model combining the actor paradigm with Communicating Sequential Processes (CSP), translating pipeline execution into reactive, event-driven actors and unifying their interactions as message passing. To support flexible specification of distributed properties, it provides a unified intent language. Additionally, it incorporates a semantic-aware state pruner to reduce verification complexity, thus ensuring system scalability. Evaluation results show that Procurator efficiently uncovers 10 distinct bugs caused by interactive behaviors across five real-world in-network systems. It also reduces verification time by up to 913.2x and memory consumption by up to 1.9x compared to the state-of-the-art verifier."}

To address this issue, we reformulate the localization problem in the modified polar representation (MPR) coordinate system, which parameterizes the source location using its azimuth, elevation, and inverse-range. We have developed a constrained weighted least squares (CWLS) estimator, which is subsequently transformed into a tight semidefinite programming (SDP) problem via semidefinite relaxation, enhanced with additional constraints to improve accuracy. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed estimator attains the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) for both angle and inverse-range estimation in near-field scenarios. More importantly, it maintains this optimal performance in the far-field, substantially outperforming state-of-the-art methods, which exhibit significant error at large ranges. The proposed solution thus provides a reliable, unified localization system that is effective irrespective of the source range."}

Compared with existing work that mostly considered either far-field or near-field covert communications, we consider in this paper a more general and practical mixed-field scenario, where multiple Bobs are located in either the near-field or far-field of Alice, in the presence of multiple near-field Willies. Specifically, we first consider a two-Bob-one-Willie system and show that conventional fixed-position XL-arrays suffer degraded sum-rate performance due to the energy-spread effect in mixed-field systems, which, however, can be greatly improved by subarray movement. On the other hand, for transmission covertness, it is revealed that sufficient angle difference between far-field Bob and Willie as well as adequate range difference between near-field Bob and Willie are necessary for ensuring covertness in fixed-position XL-array systems, while this requirement can be relaxed in movable XL-array systems thanks to flexible channel correlation control between Bobs and Willie. Next, for general system setups, we formulate an optimization problem to maximize the achievable sum-rate under covertness constraint. To solve this non-convex optimization problem, we first decompose it into two subproblems, corresponding to an inner problem for beamforming optimization given positions of subarrays and an outer problem for subarray movement optimization. Although these two subproblems are still non-convex, we obtain their high-quality solutions by using the successive convex approximation technique and devising a customized differential evolution algorithm, respectively. Last, numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed movable XL-array in balancing sum-rate and covert communication requirements."}

NSMs can operate in any number of dimensions, including mixed-dimensional configurations, offering wide flexibility in filter design, optional energy balancing, and preservation of the 2-ASK minimum squared Euclidean distance (MSED). Both real and rational tapped filters are investigated, and closed-form expressions are derived for the optimal real-tap filters in the one-dimensional case (MS-PRS), providing analytical insight and strong agreement with simulated bit-error behavior across wide SNR ranges. The paradigm is conceptually expanded through an analog Low-Density Generator Matrix (LDGM) formulation, which broadens the NSM family and unifies modulation and coding within a single, structurally coherent framework. When combined with LDPC coding, it enables efficient and naturally synergistic interaction between the analog modulation and the digital LDPC code. Alternatively, when analog LDGM is employed for both source coding and modulation, a simple and harmonious joint source-channel-modulation structure emerges. In both configurations, the constituent blocks exhibit dual graph-based architectures suited to message passing, achieving high flexibility and complexity-efficient operation. Collectively, these results establish promising physical-layer directions for future 6G communication systems."}

The proposed approach explicitly accounts for the mutual coupling (MC) effect, modeled via scattering parameter multiport network theory. In Stage~I, a dimension-reduced subspace-based method is proposed to estimate the common angle of arrival (AoA) at the BS using the received signals across all users. In Stage~II, MC-aware cascaded channel estimation is performed for a typical user. The equivalent measurement vectors for each cascaded path are extracted and the reference column is reconstructed using a compressed sensing (CS)-based approach. By leveraging the structure of the cascaded channel, the reference column is rearranged to estimate the AoA at the RIS, thereby reducing the computational complexity associated with estimating other columns. Additionally, the common angle of departure (AoD) at the RIS is also obtained in this stage, which significantly reduces the pilot overhead for estimating the cascaded channels of other users in Stage~III.

In this paper, we consider a monostatic sensing scenario in which OFDM is used for the downlink and its reflected echo signal is used for sensing. OFDM and discrete Fourier transform-spread OFDM (DFT-s-OFDM) are the options for uplink transmission. When OFDM is used in the uplink, the power difference between this signal and the echo signal leads to a power-domain non-orthogonal multiple access (PD-NOMA) scenario. In contrast, adopting DFT-s-OFDM as uplink signal enables a waveform-domain NOMA(WD-NOMA). Affine frequency-division multiplexing (AFDM) and orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) have been proven to be DFT-s-OFDM based waveforms. This work focuses on such a WD-NOMA system, where AFDM or OTFS is used as uplink waveform and OFDM is employed for downlink transmission and sensing. We show that the OFDM signal exhibits additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN)-like behavior in the affine domain, allowing it to be modeled as white noise in uplink symbol detection. To enable accurate data detection performance, an AFDM frame design and a noise power estimation (NPE) method are developed. Furthermore, a two-dimensional orthogonal matching pursuit (2D-OMP) algorithm is applied for sensing by iteratively identifying delay-Doppler components of each target.

In OTFS, the data symbols are mapped to the Doppler-Delay (DD) domain. In this paper, we address bandwidth-efficient estimation of channel state information (CSI) for MIMO OTFS systems. Existing channel estimation techniques either require non-overlapped DD-domain pilots and associated guard regions across multiple antennas, sacrificing significant communication rate as the number of transmit antennas increases, or sophisticated algorithms to handle overlapped pilots, escalating the cost and complexity of receivers. We introduce a novel pilot-aided channel estimation method that enjoys low overhead while achieving high performance. Our approach embeds pilots within each OTFS burst in the Time-Frequency (TF) domain. We propose a novel use of TF and DD guard bins, aiming to preserve waveform orthogonality on the pilot bins and DD data integrity, respectively. The receiver first obtains low-complexity coarse estimates of the channel parameters. Leveraging the orthogonality, a virtual array (VA) is constructed. This enables the formulation of a sparse signal recovery (SSR) problem, in which the coarse estimates are used to build a low-dimensional dictionary matrix. The SSR solution yields high-resolution estimates of channel parameters. Simulation results show that the proposed approach achieves good performance with only a small number of pilots and guard bins.

This enables RIS phase configuration using only LoS information through a closed-form Sign Alignment (SA) rule that maximizes the channel gain. Furthermore, when the RIS is asymptotically larger than the transceiver arrays, proper RIS configuration can render the end-to-end MIMO channel in the capacity formula asymptotically diagonal, thereby eliminating inter-stream interference and enabling Over-The-Air (OTA) spatial multiplexing without channel knowledge at the transmitter. Building on this result, a waterfilling-inspired SA algorithm that allocates RIS elements to spatial streams, based on the asymptotic singular values and statistical channel parameters, is proposed. Simulation results validate the theoretical analyses, demonstrating that the proposed schemes achieve performance comparable to conventional Riemannian manifold optimization, but with orders of magnitude lower runtime."}

Comprehensive theoretical report introducing the Nyquist Signaling Modulation (NSM) and analog LDGM paradigms for unified physical-layer design. Keywords: NSM; FTN; MS-PRS; multidimensional NSM; LDGM; joint source-channel-modulation; 6G", "summary": "Nyquist Signaling Modulations (NSMs) are a new signaling paradigm inspired by faster-than-Nyquist principles but based on a distinct approach that enables controlled inter-symbol interference through carefully designed finite-impulse-response filters. NSMs can operate in any number of dimensions, including mixed-dimensional configurations, offering wide flexibility in filter design, optional energy balancing, and preservation of the 2-ASK minimum squared Euclidean distance (MSED). Both real and rational tapped filters are investigated, and closed-form expressions are derived for the optimal real-tap filters in the one-dimensional case (MS-PRS), providing analytical insight and strong agreement with simulated bit-error behavior across wide SNR ranges. The paradigm is conceptually expanded through an analog Low-Density Generator Matrix (LDGM) formulation, which broadens the NSM family and unifies modulation and coding within a single, structurally coherent framework. When combined with LDPC coding, it enables efficient and naturally synergistic interaction between the analog modulation and the digital LDPC code. Alternatively, when analog LDGM is employed for both source coding and modulation, a simple and harmonious joint source-channel-modulation structure emerges. In both configurations, the constituent blocks exhibit dual graph-based architectures suited to message passing, achieving high flexibility and complexity-efficient operation. Collectively, these results establish promising physical-layer directions for future 6G communication systems."}

However, the deployment of dense mega-constellations introduces severe interference among satellites operating over shared frequency bands. This is, in part, due to the limited flexibility of conventional frequency division duplex (FDD) systems, where fixed bands for downlink (DL) and uplink (UL) transmissions are employed. In this work, we propose dynamic re-assignment of FDD bands for improved interference management in dense deployments and evaluate the performance gain of this approach. To this end, we formulate a joint optimization problem that incorporates dynamic band assignment, user scheduling, and power allocation in both directions. This non-convex mixed integer problem is solved using a combination of equivalence transforms, alternating optimization, and state-of-the-art industrial-grade mixed integer solvers. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed approach of dynamic FDD band assignment significantly enhances system performance over conventional FDD, achieving up to 94\\% improvement in throughput in dense deployments."}

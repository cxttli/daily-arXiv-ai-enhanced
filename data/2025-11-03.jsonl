In\norder to achieve better medium access control (MAC) layer performance, 3GPP\nintroduced several new features in NR-V2X. One of the most important is the\nre-evaluation mechanism. It allows the vehicle to continuously sense resources\nbefore message transmission to avoid resource collisions. So far, only a few\narticles have studied the re-evaluation mechanism of NR-V2X, and they mainly\nfocus on network simulator that do not consider variable traffic, which makes\nanalysis and comparison difficult. In this paper, an analytical model of NR-V2X\nMode 2 is established, and a message generator is constructed by using discrete\ntime Markov chain (DTMC) to simulate the traffic pattern recommended by 3GPP\nadvanced V2X services. Our study shows that the re-evaluation mechanism\nimproves the reliability of NR-V2X transmission, but there are still local\nimprovements needed to reduce latency."}

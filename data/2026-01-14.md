Abstract: We study the theoretical problem of synthesizing multiple DNA strands under spatial constraints, motivated by large-scale DNA synthesis technologies. In this setting, strands are arranged in an array and synthesized according to a fixed global synthesis sequence, with the restriction that at most one strand per row may be synthesized in any synthesis cycle. We focus on the basic case of two strands in a single row and analyze the expected completion time under this row-constrained model. By decomposing the process into a Markov chain, we derive analytical upper and lower bounds on the expected synthesis time. We show that a simple laggard-first policy achieves an asymptotic expected completion time of (q+3)L/2 for any alphabet of size q, and that no online policy without look-ahead can asymptotically outperform this bound. For the binary case, we show that allowing a single-symbol look-ahead strictly improves performance, yielding an asymptotic expected completion time of 7L/3. Finally, we present a dynamic programming algorithm that computes the optimal offline schedule for any fixed pair of sequences. Together, these results provide the first analytical bounds for synthesis under spatial constraints and lay the groundwork for future studies of optimal synthesis policies in such settings.

Abstract: This paper identifies the Stein-exponent of distributed detection when the sensor communicates to the decision center over a discrete memoryless channel (DMC) subject to one of three stringent communication constraints: 1) The number of channel uses of the DMC grows sublinearly in the number of source observations n; 2) The number of channel uses is n but a block-input cost constraint is imposed almost surely, which grows sublinearly in n; 3) The block-input constraint is imposed only on expectation. We identify a dichotomy in the Stein-exponent of all these setups depending on the structure of the DMC's transition law. Under any of these three constraints, when the DMC is partially-connected (i.e., some outputs cannot be induced by certain inputs) the Stein-exponent matches the exponent identified by Han and Kobayashi and by Shalaby and Papamarcou for the scenario where communication is of zero-rate but over a noiseless link. We prove our result by adapting Han's zero-rate coding strategy to partially-connected DMCs.
  In contrast, for fully-connected DMCs, in our scenarios 1) and 2) the Stein-exponent collapses to that of a local test at the decision center, rendering the remote sensor and communication useless. %To prove this result, we propose new converse proofs relying on change of measure arguments.
  In scenario 3), the sensor remains beneficial even for fully-connected DMCs, however also collapses compared to the case of a partially-connected DMC. Moreover, the Stein-exponent is larger when the expectation constraint is imposed only under the null hypothesis compared to when it is imposed under both hypotheses. To prove these results, we propose both new coding strategies and new converse proofs.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Extracting higher-order structures from multivariate data has become an area of intensive study in complex systems science, as these multipartite interactions can reveal insights into fundamental features of complex systems like emergent phenomena. Information theory provides a natural language for exploring these interactions, as it elegantly formalizes the problem of comparing ``wholes" and ``parts" using joint, conditional, and marginal entropies. A large number of distinct statistics have been developed over the years, all aiming to capture different aspects of ``higher-order" information sharing. Here, we show that three of them (the dual total correlation, S-information, and O-information) are special cases of a more general function, $Δ^{k}$ which is parameterized by a free parameter $k$. For different values of $k$, we recover different measures: $Δ^{0}$ is equal to the S-information, $Δ^{1}$ is equal to the dual total correlation, and $Δ^{2}$ is equal to the negative O-information. Generally, the $Δ^{k}$ function is arranged into a hierarchy of increasingly high-order synergies; for a given value of $k$, if $Δ^{k}>0$, then the system is dominated by interactions with order greater than $k$, while if $Δ^{k}<0$, then the system is dominated by interactions with order lower than $k$. $Δ^{k}=0$ if the system is composed entirely of synergies of order-k. Using the entropic conjugation framework, we also find that the conjugate of $Δ^{k}$, which we term $Γ^{k}$ is arranged into a similar hierarchy of increasingly high-order redundancies. These results provide new insights into the nature of both higher-order redundant and synergistic interactions, and helps unify the existing zoo of measures into a more coherent structure.

Abstract: Flag codes generalize constant dimension codes by considering sequences of nested subspaces with prescribed dimensions as codewords. A comprehensive construction, which unites cyclic orbit flag codes, yields two families of flag codes on $\mathbb{F}^n_q$ (where $n=sk+h$ with $s\geq 2$ and $0\leq h < k$): optimum distance flag codes of the longest possible type vector $(1, 2, \ldots, k, n-k, \ldots, n-1)$ and flag codes with longer type vectors $(1, 2, \ldots, k+h, 2k+h, \ldots, (s-2)k+h, n-k, \ldots, n-1)$. These flag codes achieve the same cardinality $\sum^{s-1}_{i=1}q^{ik+h}+1$.

Abstract: Current cellular systems achieve high spectral efficiency through Massive MIMO, which leverages an abundance of antennas to create favorable propagation conditions for multiuser spatial multiplexing. Looking towards future networks, the extrapolation of this paradigm leads to systems with many hundreds of antennas per base station, raising concerns regarding hardware complexity, cost, and power consumption. This article suggests more intelligent array designs that reduce the need for excessive antenna numbers. We revisit classical uniform array design principles and explain how their uniform spatial sampling leads to unnecessary redundancies in practical deployment scenarios. By exploiting non-uniform sparse arrays with site-specific antenna placements -- based on either pre-optimized irregular arrays or real-time movable antennas -- we demonstrate how superior multiuser MIMO performance can be achieved with far fewer antennas. These principles are inspired by previous works on wireless localization. We explain and demonstrate numerically how these concepts can be adapted for communications to improve the average sum rate and similar metrics. The results suggest a paradigm shift for future antenna array design, where antenna intelligence replaces sheer antenna count. This opens new opportunities for efficient, adaptable, and sustainable Gigantic MIMO systems.

Abstract: Movable antenna (MA) introduces a new degree of freedom for future wireless communication systems by enabling the adaptive adjustment of antenna positions. Its large-range movement renders wireless channels transmission into the near-field region, which brings new performance enhancement for integrated sensing and communication (ISAC). This paper proposes a novel multi-stage design framework for broadband near-field ISAC assisted by MA. The framework first divides the MA movement area into multiple subregions, and employs the Newtonized orthogonal matching pursuit algorithm (NOMP) to achieve high-precision angle estimation in each subregion. Subsequently, a method called near-field localization via subregion ray clustering (LSRC) is proposed for identifying the positions of scatterers. This method finds the coordinates of each scatterer by jointly processing the angle estimates across all subregions. Finally, according to the estimated locations of the scatterers, the near-field channel estimation (CE) is refined for improving communication performance. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme can significantly enhance MA sensing accuracy and CE, providing an efficient solution for MA-aided near-field ISAC.

Abstract: We study the generalization error of stochastic learning algorithms from an information-theoretic perspective, with a particular emphasis on deriving sharper bounds for differentially private algorithms. It is well known that the generalization error of stochastic learning algorithms can be bounded in terms of mutual information and maximal leakage, yielding in-expectation and high-probability guarantees, respectively. In this work, we further upper bound mutual information and maximal leakage by explicit, easily computable formulas, using typicality-based arguments and exploiting the stability properties of private algorithms. In the first part of the paper, we strictly improve the mutual-information bounds by Rodríguez-Gálvez et al. (IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory, 2021). In the second part, we derive new upper bounds on the maximal leakage of learning algorithms. In both cases, the resulting bounds on information measures translate directly into generalization error guarantees.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: In this paper, we present an efficient algorithm to sample random sparse matrices to be used as check matrices for quantum Low-Density Parity-Check (LDPC) codes. To ease the treatment, we mainly describe our algorithm as a technique to sample a dual-containing binary LDPC code, hence, a sparse matrix $\mathbf H\in\mathbb F_2^{r\times n}$ such that $\mathbf H\mathbf H^\top = \mathbf 0$. However, as we show, the algorithm can be easily generalized to sample dual-containing LDPC codes over non binary finite fields as well as more general quantum stabilizer LDPC codes.
  While several constructions already exist, all of them are somewhat algebraic as they impose some specific property (e.g., the matrix being quasi-cyclic). Instead, our algorithm is purely combinatorial as we do not require anything apart from the rows of $\mathbf H$ being sparse enough. In this sense, we can think of our algorithm as a way to sample sparse, self-orthogonal matrices that are as random as possible.
  Our algorithm is conceptually very simple and, as a key ingredient, uses Information Set Decoding (ISD) to sample the rows of $\mathbf H$, one at a time. The use of ISD is fundamental as, without it, efficient sampling would not be feasible. We give a theoretical characterization of our algorithm, determining which ranges of parameters can be sampled as well as the expected computational complexity. Numerical simulations and benchmarks confirm the feasibility and efficiency of our approach.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We consider the classical problem of discrete distribution estimation using i.i.d. samples in a novel scenario where additional side information is available on the distribution. In large alphabet datasets such as text corpora, such side information arises naturally through word semantics/similarities that can be inferred by closeness of vector word embeddings, for instance. We consider two specific models for side information--a local model where the unknown distribution is in the neighborhood of a known distribution, and a partial ordering model where the alphabet is partitioned into known higher and lower probability sets. In both models, we theoretically characterize the improvement in a suitable squared-error risk because of the available side information. Simulations over natural language and synthetic data illustrate these gains.

Abstract: This article characterizes new boundary points on the capacity region of certain classes of more capable broadcast channels (BC) with uni-directional cooperation from the stronger to the weaker receiver. The new boundary points are achieved by a simple coding scheme that employs superposition coding at the transmitter with decode and forward at the stronger receiver. We evaluate our general result for Gaussian BCs and for a BC consisting of a binary erasure channel (BEC) to the stronger receiver and a binary symmetric channel (BSC) to the weaker receiver.

Abstract: Quantum low-density parity-check (QLDPC) codes provide a practical balance between error-correction capability and implementation complexity in quantum error correction (QEC). In this paper, we propose an algebraic construction based on dyadic matrices for designing both classical and quantum LDPC codes. The method first generates classical binary quasi-dyadic LDPC codes whose Tanner graphs have girth 6. It is then extended to the Calderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS) framework, where the two component parity-check matrices are built to satisfy the compatibility condition required by the recently introduced CAMEL-ensemble quaternary belief propagation decoder. This compatibility condition ensures that all unavoidable cycles of length 4 are assembled in a single variable node, allowing the mitigation of their detrimental effects by decimating that variable node.

Abstract: We study the problem of computing matrix chain multiplications in a distributed computing cluster. In such systems, performance is often limited by the straggler problem, where the slowest worker dominates the overall computation latency. To resolve this issue, several coded computing strategies have been proposed, primarily focusing on the simplest case: the multiplication of two matrices. These approaches successfully alleviate the straggler effect, but they do so at the expense of higher computational complexity and increased storage needs at the workers. However, in many real-world applications, computations naturally involve long chains of matrix multiplications rather than just a single two-matrix product. Extending univariate polynomial coding to this setting has been shown to amplify the costs -- both computation and storage overheads grow significantly, limiting scalability. In this work, we propose two novel multivariate polynomial coding schemes specifically designed for matrix chain multiplication in distributed environments. Our results show that while multivariate codes introduce additional computational cost at the workers, they can dramatically reduce storage overhead compared to univariate extensions. This reveals a fundamental trade-off between computation and storage efficiency, and highlights the potential of multivariate codes as a practical solution for large-scale distributed linear algebra tasks.

Abstract: In this paper, we have introduced the concepts of support distribution and the support enumerator as refinements of the classical weight distribution and weight enumerator respectively, capturing coordinate level activity in linear block codes. More precisely, we have established formula for counting codewords in the linear code C whose i-th coordinate is nonzero. Moreover, we derived a MacWilliam's type identity, relating the normalized support enumerators of a linear code and its dual, explaining how coordinate information transforms under duality. Using this identity we deduce a condition for self duality based on the equality of support distributions. These results provide a more detailed understanding of code structure and complement classical weight based duality theory.

Abstract: Locally repairable codes (LRCs) were originally introduced to enable efficient recovery from erasures in distributed storage systems by accessing only a small number of other symbols. While their structural properties-such as bounds and constructions-have been extensively studied, the performance of LRCs under random erasures and errors has remained largely unexplored. In this work, we study the error- and erasure-correction performance of binary linear LRCs under majority-logic decoding (MLD). Focusing on LRCs with fixed locality and varying availability, we derive explicit upper bounds on the probability of decoding failure over the memoryless Binary Erasure Channel (BEC) and Binary Symmetric Channel (BSC). Our analysis characterizes the behavior of the bit-error rate (BER) and block-error rate (BLER) as functions of the locality and availability parameters. We show that, under mild growth conditions on the availability, the block decoding failure probability vanishes asymptotically, and that majority-logic decoding can successfully correct virtually all of error and erasure patterns of weight linear in the blocklength. The results reveal a substantial gap between worst-case guarantees and typical performance under stochastic channel models.

Abstract: The received in-phase and quadrature (I/Q) baseband signals inherently encode physical-layer and channel characteristics of wireless links. Learning robust and transferable representations directly from such raw signals, however, remains challenging due to heterogeneous communication systems, diverse propagation environments, and limited labeled data. To address this, we present LWM-Spectro, a transformer-based foundation model pretrained on large-scale I/Q data represented as time-frequency spectrograms. The model leverages self-supervised masked modeling, contrastive learning, and a mixture-of-experts (MoE) architecture to learn general-purpose wireless representations. These representations transfer effectively to downstream tasks such as modulation classification and joint SNR/mobility recognition, even with minimal supervision. Across tasks, LWM-Spectro consistently outperforms state-of-the-art deep learning baselines in both few-shot and data-rich regimes, providing a unified foundation for wireless learning.

Abstract: Device-edge collaborative inference with Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) faces fundamental trade-offs among accuracy, latency and energy consumption. Current scheduling exhibits two drawbacks: a granularity mismatch between coarse, task-level decisions and fine-grained, packet-level channel dynamics, and insufficient awareness of per-task complexity. Consequently, scheduling solely at the task level leads to inefficient resource utilization. This paper proposes a novel ENergy-ACcuracy Hierarchical optimization framework for split Inference, named ENACHI, that jointly optimizes task- and packet-level scheduling to maximize accuracy under energy and delay constraints. A two-tier Lyapunov-based framework is developed for ENACHI, with a progressive transmission technique further integrated to enhance adaptivity. At the task level, an outer drift-plus-penalty loop makes online decisions for DNN partitioning and bandwidth allocation, and establishes a reference power budget to manage the long-term energy-accuracy trade-off. At the packet level, an uncertainty-aware progressive transmission mechanism is employed to adaptively manage per-sample task complexity. This is integrated with a nested inner control loop implementing a novel reference-tracking policy, which dynamically adjusts per-slot transmit power to adapt to fluctuating channel conditions. Experiments on ImageNet dataset demonstrate that ENACHI outperforms state-of-the-art benchmarks under varying deadlines and bandwidths, achieving a 43.12\% gain in inference accuracy with a 62.13\% reduction in energy consumption under stringent deadlines, and exhibits high scalability by maintaining stable energy consumption in congested multi-user scenarios.

Abstract: This paper considers a downlink Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS)-assisted Joint Communication and Sensing (JCAS) system within a physically-consistent setting, accounting for the effect of mutual coupling between RIS elements arising due to sub-element spacing. The system features a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) terrestrial base station (BS) and explores both monostatic and bistatic radar configurations to enable joint communication and sensing. In the monostatic configuration, both the transmitter and receiver are at the same location, while the bistatic configuration separates the transmitter and receiver spatially. System performance is evaluated using Fisher Information (FI) to quantify sensing accuracy and Mutual Information (MI) to measure communication efficiency. To achieve an optimal balance between communication and sensing, the RIS reflective coefficients and BS transmit beamforming are jointly optimized by maximizing a weighted sum of FI and MI. A novel solution approach is proposed for a single-user, single-object scenario, leveraging the mutual coupling model to enhance system realism. The impact of self-interference on sensing performance is also investigated through signal quantization. Numerical results reveal a fundamental trade-off between FI and MI and demonstrate that incorporating mutual coupling within a physically-consistent framework significantly improves both communication and sensing performance compared to conventional RIS-assisted JCAS models. Additionally, the analysis highlights how the choice of monostatic versus bistatic radar configuration affects system performance, offering valuable insights for the design of RIS-assisted JCAS systems.

Abstract: This paper investigates the Pareto boundary performance of a joint communication and sensing (JCAS) system that addresses both sensing and communication functions at the same time. In this scenario, a multiple-antenna base station (BS) transmits information to multiple single-antenna communication users while concurrently estimating the parameters of a single sensing object using the echo signal. We present an integrated beamforming approach for JCAS in a multi-user multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) system. The performance measures for communication and sensing are Fisher information (FI) and mutual information (MI). Our research considers two scenarios: multiple communication users with a single sensing object and a single communication user with a single sensing object. We formulate a multi-objective optimization problem to maximize the weighted sum of MI and FI, subject to a total transmit power budget for both cases. As a particular case, we address the equivalent isotropic radiated power (EIRP) for the single communication user scenario. We use the uplink-downlink duality for the multi-user case to simplify the problem and apply Lagrangian optimization and line search methods with a block-coordinate ascending technique. We use projected gradient descent (PGD) to solve the optimization problem in the single-user case. Our numerical results demonstrate that joint beamforming is optimal for the multi-user JCAS system, as opposed to independent beamforming for each user and the sensing object. Furthermore, we reveal the Pareto boundary for the multi-user case, with variations in the number of communication users and the number of transmitting and receiving antennas. We provide the Pareto boundary depending on EIRP limitations for the single-user case.

Abstract: Modern wireless applications demand testing environments that capture the full complexity of next-generation (NextG) cellular networks. While digital twins promise realistic emulation, existing solutions often compromise on physical-layer fidelity and scalability or depend on specialized hardware. We present Tiny-Twin, a CPU-Native, full-stack digital twin framework that enables realistic, repeatable 5G experimentation on commodity CPUs. Tiny-Twin integrates time-varying multi-tap convolution with a complete 5G protocol stack, supporting plug-and-play replay of diverse channel traces. Through a redesigned software architecture and system-level optimizations, Tiny-Twin supports fine-grained convolution entirely in software. With built-in real-time RIC integration and per User Equipment(UE) channel isolation, it facilitates rigorous testing of network algorithms and protocol designs. Our evaluation shows that Tiny-Twin scales to multiple concurrent UEs while preserving protocol timing and end-to-end behavior, delivering a practical middle ground between low-fidelity simulators and high-cost hardware emulators. We release Tiny-Twin as an open-source platform to enable accessible, high-fidelity experimentation for NextG cellular research.

Abstract: Nowadays, agentic AI is emerging as a transformative paradigm for next-generation communication networks, promising to evolve large language models (LLMs) from passive chatbots into autonomous operators. However, unleashing this potential requires bridging the critical gap between abstract reasoning and physical actuation, a capability we term tool intelligence. In this article, we explore the landscape of tool engineering to empower agentic AI in communications. We first analyze the functionalities of tool intelligence and its effects on communications. We then propose a systematic review for tool engineering, covering the entire lifecycle from tool creation and discovery to selection, learning, and benchmarking. Furthermore, we present a case study on tool-assisted uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAV) trajectory planning to demonstrate the realization of tool intelligence in communications. By introducing a teacher-guided reinforcement learning approach with a feasibility shield, we enable agents to intelligently operate tools. They utilize external tools to eliminate navigational uncertainty while mastering cost-aware scheduling under strict energy constraints. This article aims to provide a roadmap for building the tool-augmented intelligent agents of the 6G era.

Abstract: Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite networks are emerging as an essential communication infrastructure, with standardized 5G-based non-terrestrial networks and their integration with terrestrial systems envisioned as a key feature of 6G. However, current LEO systems still exhibit significant latency variations, limiting their suitability for latency-sensitive services. We present a detailed statistical analysis of end-to-end latency based on 500Hz experimental bidirectional one-way measurements and introduce a segmentation of the deterministic 15-second periodic behavior observed in Starlink. We characterize handover-induced boundary regions that produce latency spikes lasting approximately 140 ms at the beginning and 75 ms at the end of each cycle, followed by a stable intra-period regime, enabling accurate short-term prediction. This analysis shows that latency prediction based on long-term statistics leads to pessimistic estimates. In contrast, by exploiting the periodic structure, isolating boundary regions, and applying lightweight parametric and non-parametric models to intra-period latency distributions, we achieve 99th-percentile latency prediction errors below 50 ms. Furthermore, period-level latency prediction and classification enable adaptive transmission strategies by identifying upcoming periods where application latency requirements cannot be satisfied, necessitating the use of alternative systems.

The proposed solution addresses common limitations of traditional certification models, such as susceptibility to forgery, reliance on centralized infrastructures, and inefficient verification processes. The system is built on the TRON blockchain and integrates smart contracts written in Solidity, a decentralized web application (dApp) for user interaction, and the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) for decentralized storage of certificate metadata. The methodology comprised architectural design, smart contract development, and the implementation of a web-based interface, followed by functional, security, performance, and usability evaluations. Experimental results show that the system correctly supports certificate issuance and public verification, enforces access control, and resists common misuse scenarios. Performance analysis indicates low confirmation latency and negligible transaction costs, making the solution suitable for large-scale academic environments. Additionally, usability assessment using the System Usability Scale (SUS) resulted in a score of 76.67, indicating good user acceptance. Overall, the results demonstrate the technical feasibility and practical viability of the proposed approach, highlighting the TRON blockchain as an effective and cost-efficient infrastructure for decentralized academic certification systems.

Abstract: Ground Vibration Testing (GVT) supports aircraft certification but often requires lengthy and costly campaigns. Propeller-driven Vibration Testing (PVT) is assessed here as an output-only alternative, in line with Operational Modal Analysis approaches such as Taxi Vibration Testing and Flight Vibration Testing. A cantilever Aluminium 7075-T6 wing spar is instrumented with seven accelerometers and excited by an outboard electric motor and propeller. Seven runs are carried out: a motor-off baseline, five constant-throttle cases, and a manual up-down throttle sweep. The acquired spectra indicate that the dominant resonances remain observable under propeller excitation, while low-throttle conditions introduce narrowband harmonics that may mask structural peaks; the sweep reduces persistent overlap. Modal parameters are identified for the baseline and sweep cases using the Natural Excitation Technique with the Loewner Framework (NExT-LF). The first two modes remain closely matched (Modal Assurance Criterion (MAC) > 0.99), whereas the third mode shows reduced repeatability (MAC = 0.827) and a larger frequency shift, consistent with propeller-induced bending--torsion coupling and non-ideal sweep control. Overall, PVT provides a viable complement to GVT for extracting low-frequency modal information and motivates pursuing future work on automated throttle scheduling and coupling-aware test planning.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a variable-length wideband channel state information (CSI) feedback scheme for Frequency Division Duplex (FDD) massive multiple-input multipleoutput (MIMO) systems in U6G band (6425MHz-7125MHz). Existing compressive sensing (CS)-based and deep learning (DL)- based schemes preprocess the channel by truncating it in the angular-delay domain. However, the energy leakage effect caused by the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) basis will be more serious and leads to a bottleneck in recovery accuracy when applied to wideband channels such as those in U6G. To solve this problem, we introduce the Loewner Interpolation (LI) framework which generates a set of dynamic bases based on the current CSI matrix, enabling highly efficient compression in the frequency domain. Then, the LI basis is further compressed in the spatial domain through a neural network. To achieve a flexible trade-off between feedback overhead and recovery accuracy, we design a rateless auto-encoder trained with tail dropout and a multi-objective learning schedule, supporting variable-length feedback with a singular model. Meanwhile, the codewords are ranked by importance, ensuring that the base station (BS) can still maintain acceptable reconstruction performance under limited feedback with tail erasures. Furthermore, an adaptive quantization strategy is developed for the feedback framework to enhance robustness. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme could achieve higher CSI feedback accuracy with less or equal feedback overhead, and improve spectral efficiency compared with baseline schemes.

Abstract: Battery-free Internet of Things (BF-IoT) enabled by backscatter communication is a rapidly evolving technology offering advantages of low cost, ultra-low power consumption, and robustness. However, the practical deployment of BF-IoT is significantly constrained by the limited communication range of common backscatter tags, which typically operate with a range of merely a few meters due to inherent round-trip path loss. Meta-backscatter systems that utilize metamaterial tags present a promising solution, retaining the inherent advantages of BF-IoT while breaking the critical communication range barrier. By leveraging densely paved sub-wavelength units to concentrate the reflected signal power, metamaterial tags enable a significant communication range extension over existing BF-IoT tags that employ omni-directional antennas. In this paper, we synthesize the principles and paradigms of metamaterial sensing to establish a unified design framework and a forward-looking research roadmap. Specifically, we first provide an overview of backscatter communication, encompassing its development history, working principles, and tag classification. We then introduce the design methodology for both metamaterial tags and their compatible transceivers. Moreover, we present the implementation of a meta-backscatter system prototype and report the experimental results based on it. Finally, we conclude by highlighting key challenges and outlining potential avenues for future research.

Abstract: Predicting pathloss by considering the physical environment is crucial for effective wireless network planning. Traditional methods, such as ray tracing and model-based approaches, often face challenges due to high computational complexity and discrepancies between models and real-world environments. In contrast, deep learning has emerged as a promising alternative, offering accurate path loss predictions with reduced computational complexity. In our research, we introduce a ResNet-based model designed to enhance path loss prediction. We employ innovative techniques to capture key features of the environment by generating transmission (Tx) and reception (Rx) depth maps, as well as a distance map from the geographic data. Recognizing the significant attenuation caused by signal reflection and diffraction, particularly at high frequencies, we have developed a weighting map that emphasizes the areas adjacent to the direct path between Tx and Rx for path loss prediction. {Extensive simulations demonstrate that our model outperforms PPNet, RPNet, and Vision Transformer (ViT) by 1.2-3.0 dB using dataset of ITU challenge 2024 and ICASSP 2023. In addition, the floating point operations (FLOPs) of the proposed model is 60\% less than those of benchmarks.} Additionally, ablation studies confirm that the inclusion of the weighting map significantly enhances prediction performance.

Abstract: Learning-based wireless sensing has made rapid progress, yet the field still lacks a unified and reproducible experimental foundation. Unlike computer vision, wireless sensing relies on hardware-dependent channel measurements whose representations, preprocessing pipelines, and evaluation protocols vary significantly across devices and datasets, hindering fair comparison and reproducibility.
  This paper proposes the Sensing Data Protocol (SDP), a protocol-level abstraction and unified benchmark for scalable wireless sensing. SDP acts as a standardization layer that decouples learning tasks from hardware heterogeneity. To this end, SDP enforces deterministic physical-layer sanitization, canonical tensor construction, and standardized training and evaluation procedures, decoupling learning performance from hardware-specific artifacts. Rather than introducing task-specific models, SDP establishes a principled protocol foundation for fair evaluation across diverse sensing tasks and platforms. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SDP achieves competitive accuracy while substantially improving stability, reducing inter-seed performance variance by orders of magnitude on complex activity recognition tasks. A real-world experiment using commercial off-the-shelf Wi-Fi hardware further illustrating the protocol's interoperability across heterogeneous hardware. By providing a unified protocol and benchmark, SDP enables reproducible and comparable wireless sensing research and supports the transition from ad hoc experimentation toward reliable engineering practice.

Abstract: This paper introduces a scheme for drone surveillance coordinated with the fifth generation (5G) synchronization signal block (SSB) cell-search procedure to simultaneously detect low-altitude drones within a volumetric surveillance grid. Herein, we consider a multistatic configuration where multiple access points (APs) collaboratively illuminate the volume while independently transmitting SSB broadcast signals. Both tasks are performed through a beam sweeping. In the proposed scheme, coordinated APs send sensing beams toward a grid of voxels within the volumetric surveillance region simultaneously with the 5G SSB burst. To prevent interference between communication and sensing signals, we propose a precoder design that guarantees orthogonality of the sensing beam and the SSB in order to maximize the sensing signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) while ensuring a specified SINR for users, as well as minimizing the impact of the direct link. The results demonstrate that the proposed precoder outperforms the non-coordinated precoder and is minimally affected by variations in drone altitude.

Abstract: Particle based communication using diffusion and advection has emerged as an alternative signaling paradigm recently. While most existing studies assume constant flow conditions, real macro scale environments such as atmospheric winds exhibit time varying behavior. In this work, airborne particle communication under time varying advection is modeled as a linear time varying (LTV) channel, and a closed form, time dependent channel impulse response is derived using the method of moving frames. Based on this formulation, the channel is characterized through its power delay profile, leading to the definition of channel dispersion time as a physically meaningful measure of channel memory and a guideline for symbol duration selection. System level simulations under directed, time varying wind conditions show that waveform design is critical for performance, enabling multi symbol modulation using a single particle type when dispersion is sufficiently controlled. The results demonstrate that time varying diffusion advection channels can be systematically modeled and engineered using communication theoretic tools, providing a realistic foundation for particle based communication in complex flow environments.

Abstract: Many areas in science and engineering now have access to technologies that enable the rapid collection of overwhelming data volumes. While these datasets are vital for understanding phenomena from physical to biological and social systems, the sheer magnitude of the data makes even simple storage, transmission, and basic processing highly challenging. To enable efficient and accurate execution of these data processing tasks, we require new dimensionality reduction tools that 1) do not need expensive, time-consuming training, and 2) preserve the underlying geometry of the data that has the information required to understand the measured system. Specifically, the geometry to be preserved is that induced by the fact that in many applications, streaming high-dimensional data evolves on a low-dimensional attractor manifold. Importantly, we may not know the exact structure of this manifold a priori. To solve these challenges, we present randomized filtering (RF), which leverages a specific instantiation of randomized dimensionality reduction to provably preserve non-linear manifold structure in the embedded space while remaining data-independent and computationally efficient. In this work we build on the rich theoretical promise of randomized dimensionality reduction to develop RF as a real, practical approach. We introduce novel methods, analysis, and experimental verification to illuminate the practicality of RF in diverse scientific applications, including several simulated and real-data examples that showcase the tangible benefits of RF.

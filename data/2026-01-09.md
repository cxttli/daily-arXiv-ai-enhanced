Abstract: We introduce a geometric theory of payment channel networks that centers the polytope $W_G$ of feasible wealth distributions; liquidity states $L_G$ project onto $W_G$ via strict circulations. A payment is feasible iff the post-transfer wealth stays in $W_G$. This yields a simple throughput law: if $ζ$ is on-chain settlement bandwidth and $ρ$ the expected fraction of infeasible payments, the sustainable off-chain bandwidth satisfies $S = ζ/ ρ$.
  Feasibility admits a cut-interval view: for any node set S, the wealth of S must lie in an interval whose width equals the cut capacity $C(δ(S))$. Using this, we show how multi-party channels (coinpools / channel factories) expand $W_G$. Modeling a k-party channel as a k-uniform hyperedge widens every cut in expectation, so $W_G$ grows monotonically with k; for single nodes the expected accessible wealth scales linearly with $k/n$.
  We also analyze depletion. Under linear, asymmetric fees, cost-minimizing flow within a wealth fiber pushes cycles to the boundary, generically depleting channels except for a residual spanning forest. Three mitigation levers follow: (i) symmetric fees per direction, (ii) convex/tiered fees (effective flow control but at odds with source routing without liquidity disclosure), and (iii) coordinated replenishment (choose an optimal circulation within a fiber).
  Together, these results explain why two-party meshes struggle to scale and why multi-party primitives are more capital-efficient, yielding higher expected payment bandwidth. They also show how fee design and coordination keep operation inside the feasible region, improving reliability.

Abstract: This study addresses the challenge of optimal power allocation in stochastic wireless networks by employing a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) framework. Specifically, we design a Deep Q-Network (DQN) agent capable of learning adaptive power control policies directly from channel state observations, effectively bypassing the need for explicit system models. We formulate the resource allocation problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and benchmark the proposed approach against classical heuristics, including fixed allocation, random assignment, and the theoretical water-filling algorithm. Empirical results demonstrate that the DQN agent achieves a system throughput of 3.88 Mbps, effectively matching the upper limit of the water fill, while outperforming the random and fixed allocation strategies by approximately 73% and 27%, respectively. Moreover, the agent exhibits emergent fairness, maintaining a Jain's Index of 0.91, and successfully optimizes the trade-off between spectral efficiency and energy consumption. These findings substantiate the efficacy of model-free DRL as a robust and scalable solution for resource management in next-generation communication systems.

Abstract: Wireless communications have been at the center of the revolution in technology for the last few years. The 5G communication system is the pinnacle of these technologies; however 4G LTE, WiFi, and even satellite technologies are still employed worldwide. So, the aim of the next generation network is to take advantage of these technologies for the better of the end users. Our research analyzes this subject and reveals a new and intelligent method that allows users to select the suitable RAT at each time and, therefore, to switch to another RAT if necessary. The Deep Q Network DQN algorithm was utilized, which is a reinforcement learning algorithm that determines judgments based on antecedent actions (rewards and punishments). The approach exhibits a high accuracy, reaching 93 percent, especially after a given number of epochs (the exploration phase), compared to typical MADM methods where the accuracy does not exceed 75 percent

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The integration of multicarrier modulation and multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) is critical for reliable transmission of wireless signals in complex environments, which significantly improve spectrum efficiency. Existing studies have shown that popular orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) and affine frequency division multiplexing (AFDM) offer significant advantages over orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) in uncoded doubly selective channels. However, it remains uncertain whether these benefits extend to coded systems. Meanwhile, the information-theoretic limit analysis of coded MIMO multicarrier systems and the corresponding low-complexity receiver design remain unclear. To overcome these challenges, this paper proposes a multi-slot cross-domain memory approximate message passing (MS-CD-MAMP) receiver as well as develops its information-theoretic (i.e., achievable rate) limit and optimal coding principle for MIMO-multicarrier modulation (e.g., OFDM, OTFS, and AFDM) systems. The proposed MS-CD-MAMP receiver can exploit not only the time domain channel sparsity for low complexity but also the corresponding symbol domain constellation constraints for performance enhancement. Meanwhile, limited by the high-dimensional complex state evolution (SE), a simplified single-input single-output variational SE is proposed to derive the achievable rate of MS-CD-MAMP and the optimal coding principle with the goal of maximizing the achievable rate. Numerical results show that coded MIMO-OFDM/OTFS/AFDM with MS-CD-MAMP achieve the same maximum achievable rate in doubly selective channels, whose finite-length performance with practical optimized low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes is only 0.5 $\sim$ 1.8 dB away from the associated theoretical limit, and has 0.8 $\sim$ 4.4 dB gain over the well-designed point-to-point LDPC codes.

Abstract: Molecular graph learning benefits from positional signals that capture both local neighborhoods and global topology. Two widely used families are spectral encodings derived from Laplacian or diffusion operators and anchor-based distance encodings built from shortest-path information, yet their precise relationship is poorly understood. We interpret distance encodings as a low-rank surrogate of diffusion geometry and derive an explicit trilateration map that reconstructs truncated diffusion coordinates from transformed anchor distances and anchor spectral positions, with pointwise and Frobenius-gap guarantees on random regular graphs. On DrugBank molecular graphs using a shared GNP-based DDI prediction backbone, a distance-driven Nyström scheme closely recovers diffusion geometry, and both Laplacian and distance encodings substantially outperform a no-encoding baseline.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) play a pivotal role in ensuring seamless connectivity for Internet of Things (IoT) devices, particularly in scenarios where conventional terrestrial networks are constrained or temporarily unavailable. However, traditional coverage-hole detection approaches, such as minimizing drive tests, are costly, time-consuming, and reliant on outdated radio-environment data, making them unsuitable for real-time applications. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a UAV-assisted framework for real-time detection and recovery of coverage holes in IoT networks. In the proposed scheme, a patrol UAV is first dispatched to identify coverage holes in regions where the operational status of terrestrial base stations (BSs) is uncertain. Once a coverage hole is detected, one or more UAVs acting as aerial BSs are deployed by a satellite or nearby operational BSs to restore connectivity. The UAV swarm is organized based on Delaunay triangulation, enabling scalable deployment and tractable analytical characterization using stochastic geometry. Moreover, a collision-avoidance mechanism grounded in multi-agent system theory ensures safe and coordinated motion among multiple UAVs. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves high efficiency in both coverage-hole detection and on-demand connectivity restoration while significantly reducing operational cost and time.

Abstract: Without requiring operational costs such as cabling and powering while maintaining reconfigurable phase-shift capability, self-sustainable reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (ssRISs) can be deployed in locations inaccessible to conventional relays or base stations, offering a novel approach to enhance wireless coverage. This study assesses the feasibility of ssRIS deployment by analyzing two harvest-and-reflect (HaR) schemes: element-splitting (ES) and time-splitting (TS). We examine how element requirements scale with key system parameters, transmit power, data rate demands, and outage constraints under both line-of-sight (LOS) and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) ssRIS-to-user equipment (UE) channels. Analytical and numerical results reveal distinct feasibility characteristics. The TS scheme demonstrates better channel hardening gain, maintaining stable element requirements across varying outage margins, making it advantageous for indoor deployments with favorable harvesting conditions and moderate data rates. However, TS exhibits an element requirement that exponentially scales to harvesting difficulty and data rate. Conversely, the ES scheme shows only linear growth with harvesting difficulty, providing better feasibility under challenging outdoor scenarios. These findings establish that TS excels in benign environments, prioritizing reliability, while ES is preferable for demanding conditions requiring operational robustness.

Abstract: An information-theoretic privacy mechanism design is studied, where an agent observes useful data $Y$ which is correlated with the private data $X$. The agent wants to reveal the information to a user, hence, the agent utilizes a privacy mechanism to produce disclosed data $U$ that can be revealed. We assume that the agent has no direct access to $X$, i.e., the private data is hidden. We study privacy mechanism design that maximizes the disclosed information about $Y$, measured by the mutual information between $Y$ and $U$, while satisfying a point-wise constraint with different privacy leakage budgets. We introduce a new measure, called the \emph{multi-level point-wise leakage}, which allows us to impose different leakage levels for different realizations of $U$. In contrast to previous studies on point-wise measures, which use the same leakage level for each realization, we consider a more general scenario in which each data point can leak information up to a different threshold. As a result, this concept also covers cases in which some data points should not leak any information about the private data, i.e., they must satisfy perfect privacy. In other words, a combination of perfect privacy and non-zero leakage can be considered. When the leakage is sufficiently small, concepts from information geometry allow us to locally approximate the mutual information. We show that when the leakage matrix $P_{X|Y}$ is invertible, utilizing this approximation leads to a quadratic optimization problem that has closed-form solution under some constraints. In particular, we show that it is sufficient to consider only binary $U$ to attain the optimal utility. This leads to simple privacy designs with low complexity which are based on finding the maximum singular value and singular vector of a matrix.

Abstract: Recovering an unknown but structured signal from its measurements is a challenging problem with significant applications in fields such as imaging restoration, wireless communications, and signal processing. In this paper, we consider the inherent problem stems from the prior knowledge about the signal's structure, such as sparsity which is critical for signal recovery models. We investigate three constrained optimization models that effectively address this challenge, each leveraging distinct forms of structural priors to regularize the solution space. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that these models exhibit robustness to noise while maintaining stability with respect to tuning parameters that is a crucial property for practical applications, when the parameter selection is often nontrivial. By providing theoretical foundations, our work supports their practical use in scenarios where measurement imperfections and model uncertainties are unavoidable. Furthermore, under mild conditions, we establish tradeoff between the sample complexity and the mismatch error.

Abstract: Rotatable antenna (RA) technology can harness additional spatial degrees of freedom by enabling the dynamic three-dimensional orientation control of each antenna. Unfortunately, the hardware cost and control complexity of traditional RA systems is proportional to the number of RAs. To address the issue, we consider a cross-linked (CL) RA structure, which enables the coordinated rotation of multiple antennas, thereby offering a cost-effective solution. To evaluate the performance of the CL-RA array, we investigate a CL-RA-aided uplink system. Specifically, we first establish system models for both antenna element-level and antenna panel-level rotation. Then, we formulate a sum rate maximization problem by jointly optimizing the receive beamforming at the base station and the rotation angles. For the antenna element-level rotation, we derive the optimal solution of the CL-RA array under the single-user case. Subsequently, for two rotation schemes, we propose an alternating optimization algorithm to solve the formulated problem in the multi-user case, where the receive beamforming and the antenna rotation angles are obtained by applying the minimum mean square error method and feasible direction method, respectively. In addition, considering the hardware limitations, we apply the genetic algorithm to address the discrete rotation angles selection problem. Simulation results show that by carefully designing the row-column partition scheme, the performance of the CL-RA architecture is quite close to that of the flexible antenna orientation scheme. Moreover, the CL antenna element-level scheme surpasses the CL antenna panel-level scheme by 25% and delivers a 128% performance improvement over conventional fixed-direction antennas.

Abstract: The high directionality of wave propagation at millimeter-wave (mmWave) carrier frequencies results in only a small number of significant transmission paths between user equipments and the basestation (BS). This sparse nature of wave propagation is revealed in the beamspace domain, which is traditionally obtained by taking the spatial discrete Fourier transform (DFT) across a uniform linear antenna array at the BS, where each DFT output is associated with a distinct beam. In recent years, beamspace processing has emerged as a promising technique to reduce baseband complexity and power consumption in all-digital massive multiuser (MU) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems operating at mmWave frequencies. However, it remains unclear whether the DFT is the optimal sparsifying transform for finite-dimensional antenna arrays. In this paper, we extend the framework of Zhai et al. for complete dictionary learning via $\ell^4$-norm maximization to the complex case in order to learn new sparsifying transforms. We provide a theoretical foundation for $\ell^4$-norm maximization and propose two suitable learning algorithms. We then utilize these algorithms (i) to assess the optimality of the DFT for sparsifying channel vectors theoretically and via simulations and (ii) to learn improved sparsifying transforms for real-world and synthetically generated channel vectors.

Abstract: Jensen's inequality, attributed to Johan Jensen -- a Danish mathematician and engineer noted for his contributions to the theory of functions -- is a ubiquitous result in convex analysis, providing a fundamental lower bound for the expectation of a convex function. In this paper, we establish rigorous refinements of this inequality specifically for twice-differentiable functions with bounded Hessians. By utilizing Taylor expansions with integral remainders, we tried to bridge the gap between classical variance-based bounds and higher-precision estimates. We also discover explicit error terms governed by Gruss-type inequalities, allowing for the incorporation of skewness and kurtosis into the bound. Using these new theoretical tools, we improve upon existing estimates for the Shannon entropy of continuous distributions and the ergodic capacity of Rayleigh fading channels, demonstrating the practical efficacy of our refinements.

Abstract: This paper bridges this critical gap by providing a systematic examination of the beamforming codebook technology, i.e., precoding matrix indicator (PMI), in the 5G NR from theoretical, standardization, and implementation perspectives. We begin by introducing the background of beamforming in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems and the signaling procedures for codebook-based beamforming in practical 5G systems. Then, we establish the fundamentals of regular codebooks and port-selection codebooks in 3GPP standards. Next, we provide rigorous technical analysis of 3GPP codebook evolution spanning Releases 15-18, with particular focus on: 1) We elucidate the core principles underlying codebook design, 2) provide clear physical interpretations for each symbolic variable in the codebook formulas, summarized in tabular form, and 3) offer intuitive visual illustrations to explain how codebook parameters convey information. These essential pedagogical elements are almost entirely absent in the often-obscure standardization documents. Through mathematical modeling, performance benchmarking, feedback comparisons, and scenario-dependent applicability analysis, we provide researchers and engineers with a unified understanding of beamforming codebooks in real-world systems. Furthermore, we identify future directions and other beamforming scenarios for ongoing research and development efforts. This work serves as both an informative tutorial and a guidance for future research, facilitating more effective collaboration between academia and industry in advancing wireless communication technologies.

Abstract: This paper investigates the fundamental communication--sensing tradeoffs of uplink dual-functional integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) multiple access under finite blocklength (FBL) constraints. Unlike conventional asymptotic analyses, we explicitly account for the limitations under FBL constraints imposed by short packets and low-latency transmission. By examining the unbiased channel state sensing estimator, we establish a geometric decomposition of the sensing error, indicating that it is jointly determined by the signal-to-noise ratio and the correlation structure of the information codebook. This insight reveals how cross-correlation among active users in the codebook geometry fundamentally constrains dual-functional ISAC performance. Consequently, we derive achievability and converse bounds that characterize the tradeoff between communication code rate and sensing accuracy in the FBL regime, with the converse further bounded by Shannon capacity. Moreover, by treating channel state sensing as a high-level sensing objective, a universal Cramér--Rao bound is derived to link channel estimation accuracy to practical sensing parameters. Examples of parameter sensing are also provided based on 3GPP standard. Numerical results validate the theoretical analysis and demonstrate the impact of blocklength, antenna dimensions, and sensing requirements.

Abstract: The graph alignment problem aims to identify the vertex correspondence between two correlated graphs. Most existing studies focus on the scenario in which the two graphs share the same vertex set. However, in many real-world applications, such as computer vision, social network analysis, and bioinformatics, the task often involves locating a small graph pattern within a larger graph. Existing graph alignment algorithms and analysis cannot directly address these scenarios because they are not designed to identify the specific subset of vertices where the small graph pattern resides within the larger graph. Motivated by this limitation, we introduce the subgraph alignment problem, which seeks to recover both the vertex set and/or the vertex correspondence of a small graph pattern embedded in a larger graph. In the special case where the small graph pattern is an induced subgraph of the larger graph and both the vertex set and correspondence are to be recovered, the problem reduces to the subgraph isomorphism problem, which is NP-complete in the worst case. In this paper, we formally formulate the subgraph alignment problem by proposing the Erdos-Renyi subgraph pair model together with some appropriate recovery criterion. We then establish almost-tight information-theoretic results for the subgraph alignment problem and present some novel approaches for the analysis.

Abstract: Radar sensing has emerged in recent years as a promising solution for unobtrusive and continuous in-home gait monitoring. This study evaluates whether a unified processing framework can be applied to radar-based spatiotemporal gait analysis independent of radar modality. The framework is validated using collocated impulse-radio ultra-wideband (IR-UWB) and frequency-modulated continuous-wave (FMCW) radars under identical processing settings, without modality-specific tuning, during repeated overground walking trials with 10 healthy participants. A modality-independent approach for automatic walking-segment identification is also introduced to ensure fair and reproducible modality performance assessment. Clinically relevant spatiotemporal gait parameters, including stride time, stride length, walking speed, swing time, and stance time, extracted from each modality were compared against gold-standard motion capture reference estimates. Across all parameters, both radar modalities achieved comparably high mean estimation accuracy in the range of 85-98%, with inter-modality differences remaining below 4.1%, resulting in highly overlapping accuracy distributions. Correlation and Bland-Altman analyses revealed minimal bias, comparable limits of agreement, and strong agreement with reference estimates, while intraclass correlation analysis demonstrated high consistency between radar modalities. These findings indicate that no practically meaningful performance differences arise from radar modality when using a shared processing framework, supporting the feasibility of radar-agnostic gait analysis systems.

Abstract: Bioelectrical properties of cells such as relative permittivity, conductivity, and characteristic time constants vary significantly between healthy and malignant cells across different frequencies. These distinctions provide a promising foundation for diagnostic and classification applications. This study systematically reviewed 33 scholarly articles to compile datasets of quantitative bioelectric parameters and evaluated their utility in predictive modeling. Three supervised machine learning algorithms- Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) were implemented and tuned using key hyperparameters to assess classification performance. Model effectiveness was evaluated using accuracy and F1 score as performance metrics. Results demonstrate that Random Forest achieved the highest predictive accuracy of ~ 90% when configured with a maximum depth of 4 and 100 estimators. These findings highlight the potential of integrating bioelectrical property analysis with machine learning for improved diagnostic decision-making. Similarly, for KNN and SVM, the F1 score peaked at approximately 78% and 76.5%, respectively. Future work will explore incorporating additional discriminative features, leveraging stimulated datasets, and optimizing hyperparameter through advanced search strategies. Ultimately, hardware prototype with embedded micro-electrodes and real-time control systems could pave the path for practical diagnostic tools capable of in-situ cell classification.

Abstract: The environmental and target-related information inherently carried in wireless signals, such as channel state information (CSI), has brought increasing attention to integrated sensing and communication (ISAC). However, it also raises pressing concerns about privacy leakage through eavesdropping. While existing efforts have attempted to mitigate this issue, they either fail to account for the needs of legitimate communication and sensing users or rely on hardware with high complexity and cost. To overcome these limitations, we propose PrivISAC, a plug-and-play, low-cost solution that leverages RIS to protect user privacy while preserving ISAC performance. At the core of PrivISAC is a novel strategy in which each RIS row is assigned two distinct beamforming vectors, from which we deliberately construct a limited set of RIS configurations. During operation, exactly one configuration is randomly activated at each time slot to introduce additional perturbations, effectively masking sensitive sensing information from unauthorized eavesdroppers. To jointly ensure privacy protection and communication performance, we design the two vectors such that their responses remain nearly identical in the communication direction, thereby preserving stable, high-throughput transmission, while exhibiting pronounced differences in the sensing direction, which introduces sufficient perturbations to thwart eavesdroppers. Additionally, to enable legitimate sensing under such randomized configurations, we introduce a time-domain masking and demasking method that allows the authorized receiver to associate each CSI sample with its underlying configuration and eliminate configuration-induced discrepancies, thereby recovering valid CSI. We implement PrivISAC on commodity wireless devices and experiment results show that PrivISAC provides strong privacy protection while preserving high-quality legitimate ISAC.

Abstract: This paper presents a method for estimating significant wave height (Hs) from sparse S_pectral P_oint using a T_ransformer-based approach (SPT). Based on empirical observations that only a minority of spectral points with strong power contribute to wave energy, the proposed SPT effectively integrates geometric and spectral characteristics of ocean surface waves to estimate Hs through multi-dimensional feature representation. The experiment reveals an intriguing phenomenon: the learned features of SPT align well with physical dispersion relations, where the contribution-score map of selected points is concentrated along dispersion curves. Compared to conventional vision networks that process image sequences and full spectra, SPT demonstrates superior performance in Hs regression while consuming significantly fewer computational resources. On a consumer-grade GPU, SPT completes the training of regression model for 1080 sea clutter image sequences within 4 minutes, showcasing its potential to reduce deployment costs for radar wave-measuring systems. The open-source implementation of SPT will be available at https://github.com/joeyee/spt

Abstract: As wireless networks progress toward sixthgeneration (6G), understanding the spatial distribution of directional beam coverage becomes increasingly important for beam management and link optimization. Multiple-input multipleoutput (MIMO) beam map provides such spatial awareness, yet accurate construction under sparse measurements remains difficult due to incomplete spatial coverage and strong angular variations. This paper presents a tensor decomposition approach for reconstructing MIMO beam map from limited measurements. By transforming measurements from a Cartesian coordinate system into a polar coordinate system, we uncover a matrix-vector outer-product structure associated with different propagation conditions. Specifically, we mathematically demonstrate that the matrix factor, representing beam-space gain, exhibits an intrinsic Toeplitz structure due to the shift-invariant nature of array responses, and the vector factor captures distance-dependent attenuation. Leveraging these structural priors, we formulate a regularized tensor decomposition problem to jointly reconstruct line-of-sight (LOS), reflection, and obstruction propagation conditions. Simulation results confirm that the proposed method significantly enhances data efficiency, achieving a normalized mean square error (NMSE) reduction of over 20% compared to state-of-the-art baselines, even under sparse sampling regimes.

Abstract: Motivated by single-particle cryo-electron microscopy, multi-reference alignment (MRA) models the task of recovering an unknown signal from multiple noisy observations corrupted by random rotations. The standard approach, expectation-maximization (EM), often becomes computationally prohibitive, particularly in low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) settings. We introduce an alternative, ultra-fast algorithm for MRA over the special orthogonal group $\mathrm{SO}(2)$. By performing a Taylor expansion of the log-likelihood in the low-SNR regime, we estimate the signal by sequentially computing data-driven averages of observations. Our method requires only one pass over the data, dramatically reducing computational cost compared to EM. Numerical experiments show that the proposed approach achieves high accuracy in low-SNR environments and provides an excellent initialization for subsequent EM refinement.

Abstract: The spectral and energy efficiency (SE-EE) trade-off in pinching-antenna systems (PASS) is investigated in this paper. In particular, two practical operating protocols, namely waveguide multiplexing (WM) and waveguide switching (WS), are considered. A multi-objective optimization problem (MOOP) is formulated to jointly optimize the baseband and pinching beamforming for maximizing the achievable SE and EE, which is then converted into a single-objective problem via the ε-constraint method. For WM, the problem is decomposed within the alternating-optimization framework, where the baseband beamforming is optimized using the successive convex approximation, and the pinching beamforming is updated through the particle swarm optimization. For WS, due to the time-division transmission and interference-free nature, the pinching beamforming in each time slot is first adjusted to maximize the served user channel gain, followed by the baseband power allocation. Simulation results demonstrate that 1) PASS outperforms conventional antennas by mitigating large-scale path losses; 2) WS leads to a higher maximum achievable EE by activating a single RF chain, whereas WM yields a higher SE upper bound by serving all users concurrently; and 3) increasing the number of users substantially enhances SE under WM, whereas WS shows more pronounced benefits in low-signal-to-noise ratio regimes.

Abstract: This paper investigates a six-dimensional movable antenna (6DMA)-aided cell-free multi-user multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communication system. In this system, each distributed access point (AP) can flexibly adjust its array orientation and antenna positions to adapt to spatial channel variations and enhance communication performance. However, frequent antenna movements and centralized beamforming based on global instantaneous channel state information (CSI) sharing among APs entail extremely high signal processing delay and system overhead, which is difficult to be practically implemented in high-mobility scenarios with short channel coherence time. To address these practical implementation challenges and improve scalability, a two-timescale decentralized optimization framework is proposed in this paper to jointly design the beamformer, antenna positions, and array orientations. In the short timescale, each AP updates its receive beamformer based on local instantaneous CSI and global statistical CSI. In the long timescale, the central processing unit optimizes the antenna positions and array orientations at all APs based on global statistical CSI to maximize the ergodic sum rate of all users. The resulting optimization problem is non-convex and involves highly coupled variables, thus posing significant challenges for obtaining efficient solutions. To address this problem, a constrained stochastic successive convex approximation algorithm is developed. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed 6DMA-aided cell-free system with decentralized beamforming significantly outperforms other antenna movement schemes with less flexibility and even achieves a performance comparable to that of the centralized beamforming benchmark.

Abstract: The temporal evolution of the propagation environment plays a central role in integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems. A slow-time evolution manifests as channel aging in communication links, while a fast-time one is associated with structured clutter with non-zero Doppler. Nevertheless, the joint impact of these two phenomena on ISAC performance has been largely overlooked. This addresses this research gap in a network utilizing orthogonal frequency division multiplexing waveforms. Here, a base station simultaneously serves multiple user equipment (UE) devices and performs monostatic sensing. Channel aging is captured through an autoregressive model with exponential correlation decay. In contrast, clutter is modeled as a collection of uncorrelated, coherent patches with non-zero Doppler, resulting in a Kronecker-separable covariance structure. We propose an aging-aware channel estimator that uses prior pilot observations to estimate the time-varying UE channels, characterized by a non-isotropic multipath fading structure. The clutter's structure enables a novel low-complexity sensing pipeline: clutter statistics are estimated from raw data and subsequently used to suppress the clutter's action, after which target parameters are extracted through range-angle and range-velocity maps. We evaluate the influence of frame length and pilot history on channel estimation accuracy and demonstrate substantial performance gains over block fading in low-to-moderate mobility regimes. The sensing pipeline is implemented in a clutter-dominated environment, demonstrating that effective clutter suppression can be achieved under practical configurations. Furthermore, our results show that dedicated sensing streams are required, as communication beams provide insufficient range resolution.

Abstract: In addition to satellite systems, carrier phase positioning (CPP) is gaining attraction also in terrestrial mobile networks, particularly in 5G New Radio evolution toward 6G. One key challenge is to resolve the integer ambiguity problem, as the carrier phase provides only relative position information. This work introduces and studies a multi-band CPP scenario with intra- and inter-band carrier aggregation (CA) opportunities across FR1, mmWave-FR2, and emerging 6G FR3 bands. Specifically, we derive multi-band CPP performance bounds, showcasing the superiority of multi-band CPP for high-precision localization in current and future mobile networks, while noting also practical imperfections such as clock offsets between the user equipment (UE) and the network as well as mutual clock imperfections between the network nodes. A wide collection of numerical results is provided, covering the impacts of the available carrier bandwidth, number of aggregated carriers, transmit power, and the number of network nodes or base stations. The offered results highlight that only two carriers suffice to substantially facilitate resolving the integer ambiguity problem while also largely enhancing the robustness of positioning against imperfections imposed by the network-side clocks and multi-path propagation. In addition, we also propose a two-stage practical estimator that achieves the derived bounds under all realistic bandwidth and transmit power conditions. Furthermore, we show that with an additional search-based refinement step, the proposed estimator becomes particularly suitable for narrowband Internet of Things applications operating efficiently even under narrow carrier bandwidths. Finally, both the derived bounds and the proposed estimators are extended to scenarios where the bands assigned to each base station are nonuniform or fully disjoint, enhancing the practical deployment flexibility.
